Now, the time of mortals had come. The settlement of Mytros expanded into a great city, and it was protected by the twin Colossi forged by Volkanâ€”beacons of civilization on the shores of a wild frontier. New settlers came from beyond the Forgotten Sea, and the mortal population of Thylea swelled.

The children of the Dragonlords became kings, and their dynasties ruled over new cities that sprang up across the land. As the worship of the Five spread, their power over the land and oceans grew, until every village boasted shrines to Volkan and Pythor. The dominion of Sydon and Lutheria was nearly forgotten.

Five centuries seemed like an eternity to mortals, but the time now grows near when the Oath of Peace must finally come to an end.
