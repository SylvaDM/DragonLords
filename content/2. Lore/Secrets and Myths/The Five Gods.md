The Five Gods were born when the powers of [[Sydon]] and [[Lutheria]] were stolen and infused into the bodies of five dragons who served the Dragonlords. The dragons surrendered their draconic forms and assumed new humanoid identities as lesser gods. Through the power of their pantheon, they can hear the prayers of their worshippers and grant them the power of magic.

[[Mytros]] is the wellspring of their divine power. She ascended to true godhood when she sacrificed herself to forge [[The Oath of Peace]]. For the complete story, refer to the Secrets and Myths appendix.
