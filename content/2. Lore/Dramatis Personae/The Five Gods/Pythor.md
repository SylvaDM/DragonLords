# God of Battle

>“*Step aside, sister. If this goes poorly, you can lecture my corpse tomorrow.*”
— Pythor, to [[Vallus]], before his first death at the Battle of Lethe, 17 CE

As one of the Five, Pythor is revered as the god of strength and battle. He fought tirelessly in the First War, driving back centaurs and gygans that threatened to overwhelm the city of Mytros. Many songs record his legendary exploits on the battlefield, while many others list his conquests in the bedroom.

In 330 CE, Pythor overthrew the tyrant king Lysis Arklenader and took the throne of Estoria. He has ruled that city as king and god for almost two hundred years now. His people love him, even though he has been a terrible king, prone to drunkenness and nostalgic ramblings about his past glories.

Pythor appears to be a tall, copper-haired man carrying a mithral axe. For centuries, he has walked among the settlers, taking mortals as lovers and fathering countless demi-god children. Although he wishes them all well, he takes no responsibility for any of his brood, except one: his favourite daughter, Anora.

## Pythor's True Form

Before coming to Thylea, Pythor was a young bronze dragon. He served the Dragonlord Adonis Neurdagon before the events of the First War. Pythor loved Adonis intently, and he spent decades mourning his death. 

Pythor cannot transform back into his dragon form until [[The Oath of Peace]] ends.

## Husband of Hexia

During the time of the Dragonlords, Pythor was married to his adopted sister, Hexia, a green dragon. Pythor abandoned his dragon wife when he took on his immortal humanoid form, and she has never forgiven him. Hexia has jealously dedicated her life to destroying Pythor’s happiness and, over the centuries, she has murdered many of his mortal lovers and children.

# Roleplaying Pythor

## Amorous

Pythor falls in love with literally every beautiful mortal who crosses his path. He just can’t help himself, any more than a moth can help flying towards the candle flame. He is respectful but persistent in his attentions; jubilant in victory and gracious in defeat.

## Valorous

Pythor is quick to volunteer to fight on the front lines of any battle that he happens across. These days, however, he is more often drunk than sober. He’ll never admit it, but centuries of failure and personal tragedy have taken their toll on his fighting spirit. He believes his glory days are behind him, and he seeks to drown this fact in a river of wine.
