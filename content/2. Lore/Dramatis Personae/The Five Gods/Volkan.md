# God of Forges

>“*One of these days, all this warfare will be automated. Bronze soldiers with bronze weapons, and no more bloodshed. That's my dream, anyway. Let an old man have his dream.*”
—Volkan, cranky old blacksmith of Estoria

As one of the Five, Volkan is revered as the forge god of artifice and crafting, and he is primarily worshipped by smiths, masons, and wizards. For centuries, he has been obsessed with crafting wondrous magical items, but he rarely shares these gifts with the rest of the world. In spite of this, many of his greatest works have been scattered across Thylea, and some have even fallen into the hands of his enemies.

Volkan appears to be an unassuming, grey-bearded old dwarf clad in a blacksmith’s apron. He is easily (and perhaps deliberately) overlooked by the locals in his home city of Estoria. He was less humble during the First War, when he was known to don a radiant suit of silver platemail, wear a golden crown, and carry a mighty warhammer. These days, he claims his bones ache too much to participate in battles. He prefers to smoke his pipe near the warmth of the forge-fires, pondering his next invention.

## Volkan's True Form
Volkan originally came to Thylea as an ancient bronze dragon. In that form, he and Balmytria produced four bronze dragons in the Old World many centuries ago: [[Kyrah]], [[Pythor]], [[Vallus]], and Narsus. Together, the family of dragons became the mounts of the Dragonlords. Volkan had the honour to bond with Rizon Phobas.

Volkan cannot transform back into his dragon form until [[The Oath of Peace]] ends.

# Roleplaying Volkan


## Crafty
Volkan is known for devising ingenious strategies. He thinks of the world as a puzzle to be solved, and he often works out problems in his head for days or weeks at a time. He may be gruff and silent for long stretches, only to suddenly appear with some miracle device or solution. He delights in creation, rather than destruction, and he is always intrigued by an intricate new device or stratagem.

## Reclusive
Volkan changed after the ascension of his wife. He was once an affectionate and attentive father, but when he “lost” his wife to her godhood, he grew apart from his children. He eventually came to live almost entirely in his workshop and within his own head. He has also developed a strong affinity for wine, and beer, and mead, and almost any strong drink, all of which he claims inspires his best work.
