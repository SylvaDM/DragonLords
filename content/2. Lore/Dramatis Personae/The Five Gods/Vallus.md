# Goddess of Wisdom

>“*Arrogance may afflict even the very wise. Take it from me — I married [[Acastus]].*”
— Vallus, on the subject of Hubris, 487 CE

Vallus is revered as the goddess of wisdom. She was once known to travel far and wide, surveying ancient ruins and collecting lore concerning the origins of the land and the fey races. Prayers are offered to Vallus when guidance is needed and information is scarce, and she is believed to know as much about Thylea’s history as [[Sydon]] and [[Lutheria]]. She is the oldest daughter of [[Mytros]] and, in many ways, she has inherited her mother’s place as patron goddess to the city that bears her name.

Vallus works closely with the priests of Mytros to encourage faith in the Five, even as mortals everywhere fall prey to fear of [[Sydon]] and [[Lutheria]]. She remains a pillar of strength holding the city together as things are beginning to fall apart elsewhere. However, in spite of her best efforts, the citizens of Mytros increasingly offer prayers and sacrifices to the treacherous Titans. Vallus accepts this with grace and humility, and in spite of her declining power, she will do anything to defend her city.

## Queen of Mytros

Vallus has one regret: her marriage to King [[Acastus]]. Over the centuries, she has been intimate with many beautiful mortals who captured her heart, but her union with [[Acastus]] in 478 CE was entirely political. The two have grown to hate each over the years, not least because [[Acastus]] makes a point of treating his many infidelities as sport. They have no children, although [[Acastus]] probably has many unacknowledged bastards.

## Vallus' True Form

Vallus was the young bronze dragon who served as a mount for Telamok Arkelander. While Telamok was responsible for almost as many atrocities as his brother Estor, Vallus understands this was part of the cost of settling in Thylea. She is not wracked with the same second-hand guilt that plagues [[Kyrah]].

# Roleplaying Vallus

## Vain

Vallus has a reputation for conspicuous vanity. She never allows herself to be seen without exquisite, queenly regalia, and she habitually examines her own reflection in a silver hand mirror. This is partly because she understands the importance of appearances in the world of mortal politics—but she is also vain.

## Shrewd

Vallus is extraordinarily perceptive, often to the point where she is suspected of mindreading. She always seems to discern truth, even when she is told a clever lie. A hard stare from Vallus is often enough to make even the most skilled liars concede the truth.

## Pessimistic

Vallus has lost much of her faith in the future of Thylea. Although she endeavours to protect the Temple of the Five in Mytros, she has witnessed too much of Thylean history to believe that the Oracle’s prophecy will result in anything but total disaster.
