# Goddess of Music

>“*I'm told that thousands of songs have been written about me, and bards everywhere pay homage at my shrines. They even call me the Muse. But if that's the case, then why does no one ever seem to want to read my poetry?*”
— Kyrah, Goddess of Music

As one of [[The Five Gods]], Kyrah is revered as the trickster of music and poetry. There are very few shrines to her, but bards and poets call upon her for inspiration as “the Muse.” She is the swiftest of all the gods, both in thought and deed. She is capable of disappearing in the blink of an eye, and she can travel great distances with mere steps. Her mind is equally swift. Her voice is said to be more beautiful than any instrument.

Kyrah regularly travels through the Heartlands in the guise of an adventurous bard. She carries dozens of scroll-cases with her, most of which contain terrible poems of her own composition. She can write good ones, but she prefers the bad ones, because she is so amused by people's reactions to them. No matter how harsh the critique, she never holds grudges against critics. She serves as the court poet to the Queen of Mytros, her sister [[Vallus]]. [[Vallus]] finds Kyrah annoying, and she finds any excuse to send her away on errands.

## Kyrah's Motivations

Kyrah wishes above all else to write a great epic poem, something that would make even the Mother Goddess herself laugh and weep. In her search for new material, she is attracted to heroes who perform great deeds, as well as those who are fated to meet terrible ends. She is flirty, witty, clever, and attractive, but for reasons that she never makes clear, will never consent to marry anyone who cannot beat her in a foot race.

## Kyrah's True Form

Kyrah came to Thylea as a young bronze dragon. She served as the mount for the infamous Dragonlord [[Estor Arkelander]]. She is still weighed down by shame for the atrocities that Estor committed while the two of them were oathsworn. Kyrah cannot transform back into her dragon form until [[The Oath of Peace]] ends.

# Roleplaying Kyrah

## Spirited

Kyrah seeks to atone for the sins of [[Estor Arkelander]] by doing as much good as possible. She is full of optimistic energy, and she refuses to stand by when even the slightest injustices go uncorrected and unpunished

## Reckless

Kyrah detests sitting still, and her eagerness for a good story makes her a bit reckless. She will sometimes goad mortals into dangerous acts of heroism, hoping for dramatic material that she can use. However, she never acts maliciously, and she is careful to study prophecies; she doesn't make unreasonable demands.

## Mischievous

Kyrah loves to play tricks, large and small. Consequently, few people worship her, but nearly everyone believes in her. She is often “credited” when things go missing, or when objects suddenly reappear without explanation. She is especially fond of playing pranks on humourless tyrants and petty bullies, such as King [[Acastus]] of Mytros.
