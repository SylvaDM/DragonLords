# The Lord of Storms

>“*Allow me to show you the future of Thylea. And then, perhaps, you may decide whether you wish to be a part of it.*”
—Sydon, to King Acastus of Mytros

Sydon is called the Lord of Storms, but he was once revered as the lord of all Thylea. He created the most powerful native races of Thylea: the centaurs, the gygans, and the cyclopes. When humanity came to Thlyea, they conquered his lands and slaughtered his children. Chief among Sydon’s tormentors were the Dragonlords. In his anger, Sydon destroyed their dragons and sought vengeance—but then the Five Gods were born. They took his strength for their own, and forged [[The Oath of Peace]]. Now, he is a vengeful and jealous god who suffers no worship of any gods except himself or his sister-wife [[Lutheria]]. He surveys both land and water tirelessly from his stronghold in the tower of Praxys. Although his strength has diminished, he remains the god of storms and oceans, capable of sending devastating hurricanes to vent his anger. He is now gathering a power to rival that of his ancient father, the Titan [[Kentimane]].

Sydon takes the form of a colossal man, carrying a terrifying black glaive. Like his sister, Sydon has a third eye on his forehead that he can use to spy on the world, looking through the eye of any of his cyclopes or gygan servants. Sydon knows that he is powerful, and he delights in this fact. He is rightly proud of his own awesome power, prestige, and perfection.

Priests in every temple in Thylea fear the wrath of Sydon. Daily sacrifices are offered to him in every village, even as settlers offer prayers to the Five. Whenever a storm brews in Thylea, you can be sure that someone has provoked the anger of Sydon.

# Roleplaying Sydon
&nbsp;
## Jealous
Sydon considers himself the One True God of Thylea. He believes that all should bow before him, but most particularly the Five Gods, whom he loathes. He suffers no injuries to his pride. He is terrifying to behold when thwarted: his voice thunders, and his eyes flash like lightning.
## Ambitious
Sydon seeks to bring all of Thylea under his direct control by forging a new pantheon of loyal gods and lesser heroes. He envisions himself as the architect of a future Golden Age, and he is eager to share his ambitious plans with mortals, and even more eager to be praised and worshipped for this grand vision.
## Tempestuous
Sydon suffers from mood swings. He may at first seem a gracious host, lauding the virtues of his guests, only to fall into a blind rage without warning and at the merest slight. In spite of this, his anger can vanish suddenly, replaced by a child-like fear of his father, Kentimane.
