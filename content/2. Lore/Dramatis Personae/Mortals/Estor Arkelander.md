The infamous captain of the ghost ship Ultros, Estor Arkelander has sailed the waters of the Cerulean gulf for centuries. He and his crew of undead indiscriminately terrorize living sailors and landsmen. While a ship set upon by the Ultros often suffers casualties, Estor enjoys the terror he causes more than the blood he spills.

Estor was the brother of the Dragonlord Telamok Arkelander. He was intensely jealous of Telamok’s fame and sought to eclipse him whenever possible. Throughout Thylea he and his crew were famed for being fearless warriors who always sought battle: he was responsible for many of the atrocities committed during the bloodiest years of the First War.

He searched for fame and more power with increasing urgency as the First War dragged on. Eventually, this led him to take his ship to the fires of Typhos, a mysterious island where he felt that he could gain god-like power. Typhos proved to be a trap set for him by the goddess [[Lutheria]], who tricked Estor into accepting her gifts of fame and immortality. She delivered these by turning him and his crew into undead, and cursing them to sail the Cerulean Gulf for all eternity.

Estor is, and perhaps always was, cruel and calculating. His centuries as a ghost have given him focus: he is still driven by the desire to outstrip his brother in all things. Now, he seeks to do this by taking over the life of the greatest of the prophesied heroes, and using that stolen life to exact brutal vengeance against the Titans.

## Undying Ambition

For each day that Estor is allowed to possess a hero, he will consent to answer one question or reveal one secret. While possessing a hero, Estor will assume leadership of the party; he will attempt to prolong his control by offering to reveal more valuable secrets.

# Roleplaying Estor

## Hateful

Hatred has entirely consumed Estor. Cursed by undeath, he utterly loathes gods—all gods—and their insipid worshippers. He despises weakness in all forms and cares only for power.

## Experienced

Estor has traveled far and wide throughout Thylea. He knows the secrets and dangers of the Nether Sea. He is willing to share this knowledge in exchange for time spent possessing a hero.
