# King of Mytros

Acastus Arkelander has been the King of Mytros for two decades. As the husband to the goddess [[Vallus]], he is the most powerful political figure in all Thylea, and he has a towering ego to match his fame. Although he is naturally charming, he is not a man who brooks being challenged or overshadowed.

Beneath his outward confidence lies a deep-seated insecurity, because he has accomplished nothing important during his lifetime. He fears death, because he feels that he will quickly be forgotten. He desperately wishes to achieve immortality by increasing his fame, so that he will be remembered for many great deeds, like his ancestors.

Acastus has no faith in the Oracle’s prophecy, and he is immensely suspicious and jealous of her chosen “heroes.” He would rather believe that the heroes are not the answer to his kingdom’s problems. He has solutions of his own: he has depended upon the Order of [[Sydon]] to maintain peace with the Titans for years. He also plans to rebuild the ancient Order of the Dragonlords with dragon eggs that [[Lutheria]] secretly gave him.

## Dragon  Rider

King Acastus is one of several famous dragon-riders in Mytros. His mount is Icarus, an adult silver dragon who spends his time flying around the city, stealing cattle and over-fishing the waters beyond the harbor. Everyone considers Icarus to be a nuisance, but no one has ever dared to complain to the king. Acastus rides him around the city during festivals to show off his power. The dragon is only an adult because Acastus forced him to age quickly from the egg using potions of aging. Icarus still has the callow mind of a wyrmling.

## Dragonlord Descendant

Acastus’ insecurity is made worse due to a connection he has with his direct ancestor, [[Estor Arkelander]]. Estor was the Dragonlord responsible for starting the First War, and is now the infamous captain of the ghost ship, the Ultros. Every night Estor whispers in Acastus’ dreams, taunting him for his lack of achievements. The ghost has promised Acastus the immortality that he so desires, but only if he makes himself a willing vessel

## Consort of Vallus

Acastus’ marriage to the goddess [[Vallus]] has suffered over the years, mostly thanks to his own pride. He believed that winning the hand of the goddess was a sign of great things to come. Over the years, the romance turned sour as the king’s obsession with fame became clear. Now, the two can barely stand to be in the same room together and view the marriage as a sham. Acastus has brazenly taken consorts that he has openly paraded before his estranged wife.

# Roleplaying Acastus

## Charming

Acastus makes a great show of treating guests well. He conducts himself with apparent grace, humility, and amiable good cheer. His true nature is nearly impossible to discern, even by the most perceptive and suspicious observers.

## Faithless

Acastus’ loyalties change, sometimes in the space of moments, depending on his understanding of the power balance in Thylea. He is adept at making promises that he never intends to keep, but he’s careful never to swear oaths that would bind him to what might be the losing side in a battle.
