Aesop (NG elven priest) has been the Keeper of the Dragon Shrine in Estoria (E7) for centuries. He devotes much of his time to studying the histories, but he also keeps an eye on the prophecies, watching for any signs that the Order of the Dragonlords might be restored. He is widely known to be one of the wisest mortals in the land, respected even by [[Vallus]] and [[Versi the Oracle]]. Before [[The Arrival of the Dragonlords]], Aesop was part of a small tribe of elves who were kept as slaves by the gygans. Most of his tribe were killed during the early years of the First War, but just before the same fate could claim him, Aesop was rescued by Adonis Neurdagon. He never forgot his feelings of gratitudeâ€”nor his hatred for the cruelty of the Titans.

## Disciple of Adonis

Aesop was instantly smitten with Adonis Neurdagon. He swore an oath of service to the Dragonlord, and over time, the two became lovers. Adonis was famed for his wealth and beauty, as well as his bravery and generosity. He adopted many of the children that he freed from the clutches of the Titans. He and Aesop raised the children together, creating a dynasty that lasts to this day.

Unfortunately, Adonis's bravery was ill-founded. He was overconfident in his own abilities, and in spite of Aesop's repeated begging, he joined the rest of his Order in their last stand against the Titans. Their dragon mounts had disappeared years earlier, forcing them to depend on their own powers and abilities. Without the aid of his dragon, Adonis was killed.

Thereafter, Aesop founded a modest shrine in Estoria to evangelize the Dragonlords and keep records of their accomplishments in Thylea. He left the Neurdagon dynasty in the hands of his children, whose descendants have long forgotten him.


# Roleplaying Aesop


## Patient

Aesop lived alongside the original Dragonlords and was keenly aware of their flaws. His expectations for the heroes are high, but he also understands that they will not be perfect. He supports the party's quest even if they are clearly flawed as individuals.

## Focused

Aesop never loses focus on his goal: to restore the Order of the Dragonlords. He will provide whatever support he can to achieve this end. Additionally, he hopes to discover what happened to the original dragons and rescue them in the event that they've been captured by the Titans.
