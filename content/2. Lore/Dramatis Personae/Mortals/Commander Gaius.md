Gaius is the Commander of the Order of [[Sydon]]. He is a true believer who fervently wants [[Sydon]] to rule Thylea. He commands a force of over one thousand knights in Mytros and on the islands of the Cerulean Gulf. In Mytros, he can usually be found at the Temple of [[Sydon]] or the Great Palace, but he often travels to the Island of Yonder, where the ancient Gygan ruins serve as a military base for his faction.

## Dragon Rider

Gaius travels between Mytros and the Cerulean Gulf with ease thanks to Argyn, his young silver dragon mount. Argyn was raised by [[Sydon]] and given to Gaius as a reward for his loyalty. For his part, Gaius loves Argyn and has vowed to marry her when she is old enough to transform into a human. Unfortunately for Gaius, Argyn merely tolerates him. She loves only [[Sydon]], who has promised her a mountain of treasure in exchange for her loyal service to the zealot.

# Roleplaying Gaius

## Zealous

Gaius is utterly devoted to Sydonâ€™s cause, and he brooks no insult to the Titans. He spares nothing in punishing what he considers heresy, making (fatal) examples of anyone who threatens the dominion of the Lord of Storms.

## Humourless

Gaius is dour and grim-faced, and he has absolutely no sense of humor at all. He crucifies bards just to shut them up. He never drinks. Even his own men are frightened of him.
