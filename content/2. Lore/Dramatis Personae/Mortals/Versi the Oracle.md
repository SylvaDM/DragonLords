Versi is the daughter of [[Sydon]] and a naiad named Delphea. She is a water nymph like her mother, but her father’s empyrean blood gave her the power of prophecy. She was born with a third eye at the center of her forehead. She hides this with a golden diadem.

Versi has been known throughout Thylea as “the Oracle” since before the founding of Mytros. She prophesied the coming of the Dragonlords and the birth of [[The Five Gods]]. She was also instrumental in forging [[The Oath of Peace]], as she negotiated the meeting between [[The Five Gods]] and the Titans.

Versi wishes to protect both the mortals and the fey races of Thylea. She once believed that the gods and Titans could coexist peacefully, but she has witnessed too much death and destruction to sustain her optimism. Now, she puts her faith in the heroes, because they represent a chance for the best possible outcome in all her visions of the many possible futures.

# Roleplaying Versi

## Haunted

Versi is haunted by terrifying visions of the future of Thylea. She clings desperately to the hope that such dark futures will not come to pass, but a shadow of fear and doubt is always in her eyes. She knows that the heroes may very well die in their attempt to thwart [[Sydon]] and [[Lutheria]].

## Possessive

Versi thinks of all the mortals of Thylea as beautiful, cherished pets. This is doubly true of those with great destinies. She may choose to follow the heroes and check up on them from time to time, offering much-needed assistance in the way that one might offer treats to a pet dog. She will bristle with obvious jealousy if the heroes become too close to or dependent on other fey creatures or gods.
