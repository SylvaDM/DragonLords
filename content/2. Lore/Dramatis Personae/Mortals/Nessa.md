Nessa is a centaur (CG) who belongs to a cursed tribe on Scorpion Island. For the past few years, she has led a band of scouts who patrol the island, herding the giant scorpions away from the shores. Like all members of her tribe, she must bond with a mortal rider before she comes of age, or she will transform into a giant scorpion. When the heroes meet her, Nessa has a month before she comes of age, and she is desperate to find a rider.
