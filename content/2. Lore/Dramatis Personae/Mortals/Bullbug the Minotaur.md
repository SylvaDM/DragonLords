Bullbug is a pot-bellied minotaur gladiator with a sunny disposition and a penchant for drinking. Contrary to the reputation that minotaurs have in Mytros, he doesn’t have an evil disposition or a lust for blood. He has a different view on life than many of his kind, because he was raised by a human family who treated him like a son.

As a youth, Bullbug gained the distinction of being one of the few minotaurs to survive the sacrificial rituals in Mytros. He refused to kill the warriors he defeated, and so gained the sympathy of the family matron who took Bullbug into her home and raised him as a son. But then, several years ago, Bullbug's family were killed by the Order of [[Sydon]], and he was sold into slavery.

Bullbug is not very bright, but he’s reliable in a fight and he’s loyal. He loves to make terrible jokes at the expense of his own species. When he makes an especially bad mistake, he usually blames it on his “stupid cow brain.”

# Roleplaying Bullbug

## Loyal

Bullbug is always true to his word, and he would never dream of breaking an oath. He believes in the power of friendship and family. He will always be there for the people he cares for, and for those who care about him.

## Hungry

Bullbug is always hungry, and he’ll eat just about anything. He often thinks with his stomach, and this gets him into all sorts of trouble, because food is not usually free.
