Themis, the twin sister of the Amazon Queen. Her true name is Moxena, but she abandoned that name after a failed coup against her sister. She rebelled by joining with the Amazon faction who believed that the worship of [[Lutheria]] had corrupted the sisterhood. However, she had no intention of restoring the Amazons to a sisterhood of equals—she just wants to replace her sister as Queen and rule the island herself.

Having fled, she ended up in Mytros. Her political skills enabled her to establish the Cult of the Snake, a thieves’ guild that serves her with unswerving loyalty. She robs from the rich and then uses the money to purchase the freedom of minotaur slaves and other undesirables. However, she is not an altruist. She intends to use the money that she collects to hire an army. Moxena wants vengeance on her sister, but she can easily be convinced to extend her quest to include vengeance against her sister’s patron, [[Lutheria]].

# Roleplaying Moxena

## Pragmatic

Moxena may desire revenge against her sister above all things, but she is practical about it. She will form alliances with anyone who can help her attain that goal.

## Prejudiced

Moxena dislikes men as a rule and she treats them with patient but disdainful condescension. If possible, she will ignore male heroes and speak primarily to female heroes in the party.
