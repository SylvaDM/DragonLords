Steros belongs to a rare breed of cyclopes known as jancan. He was born with ten fingers per hand and ten toes per foot. Like all jancan, he is a cunning artificer, and he possesses incredible skills at the forge. He was born and raised among the cyclopes at Praxys, the Tower of [[Sydon]].

Steros stands only 9 feet tall, much shorter than other cyclopes. He was the butt of every joke at Praxys, and even [[Sydon]] treated him with contempt. Steros feels resentful toward his “family”, and he hopes to prove that they have always underestimated him. Steros’ father once served the lizard king on Fire Island, but he was captured by the Amazons during a raid. When this news reached [[Sydon]], he sent Steros to the lizard king to replace his missing father.

## Motivations

Steros wants to rescue his father from the Amazons on the Island of Themis. He also claims that he wants revenge against [[Sydon]]. This is partly true, but he secretly hopes to hand over the heroes in the belief that this will finally earn him [[Sydon]]’s respect.

## Talented Craftsman

Steros is an amazing craftsman, known for his ability to engineer incredibly life-like clockwork animals. He designed his magic monocle that grants him special powers and compensates for his race’s poor vision. Steros can operate the Mithral Forge just as well as [[Volkan]], and his monocle can be used in place of Pythor’s Hammer.

# Roleplaying Steros

## Insecure

Steros has always felt as that everyone is secretly laughing at him. He even misinterprets simple greetings and commands as somehow insulting. He’s too much of a coward to act on his anger, though.

## Awkward

Steros plans to betray the heroes, but he’s comically bad at hiding it. He even twirls his moustache and cackles to himself about his own cunning plans when he thinks no one is looking.
