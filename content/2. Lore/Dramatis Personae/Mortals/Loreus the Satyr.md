Loreus is a young satyr (CG) who had a very sheltered upbringing. He is not typical of his kind. Rather than frolicking and dallying with nymphs like other satyrs his age, Loreus spends all of his time writing love poems and reading epic romances. He is fascinated by mortal men and women, especially those who resemble the great heroes of his favourite stories.

## Lovesick

Loreus will do absolutely anything for the person he loves, no matter how dangerous or embarrassing. He will constantly seek new ways to prove his love, no matter how strange they might look to others, especially if his passion is not reciprocated.
