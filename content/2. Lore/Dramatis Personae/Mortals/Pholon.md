Pholon is a centaur (LG) who once was part of the cursed tribe on Scorpion Island. Years ago, he bonded with a man named Ankaios, a human soldier whom he loved. The two of them had many adventures across Thylea, but sadly, Ankaios was recently killed in battle. Pholon must find a new rider before the next full moon, or else he will transform into a giant scorpion.

# Roleplaying Pholon

## Adolescent

Pholon likes to party and drink mead. He’s always up for drinking, singing, or wrestling, especially with “his bros.” He’s good in a fight, but he thinks war is a real bummer.

## Loyal

Pholon is loyal to the mortal rider who bonds with him, and will be determined to be the very best of friends with that person. He's supportive to a fault, and he volunteers for anything that he deems too dangerous for his favourite bros.

# Statistics

Pholon can be used as a mount, and is proficient with all melee weapons. Once per day, he can chug mead as a bonus action, which grants him resistance to all damage types for one round.

# Encountering Pholon

Pholon can be encountered just about anywhere in Thylea, at any time in the adventure. Refer to his special encounter entry, [[Pholon the Centaur|Pholon the Centaur]] the Encounters appendix for details.
