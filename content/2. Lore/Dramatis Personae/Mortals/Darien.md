Darien (NG Amazon warrior) is the rightful heir to the throne of the Amazons. Her mother, Queen Thesilea, ruled the island of Themis along with her two sisters. But when Darien was five years old, her mother was betrayed by her closest advisors, who had transformed into medusae. They killed the three matriarchs and assumed their identities. But before the final stroke fell, Darien's mother forced the medusae to swear not to harm her youngest daughter until she comes of age. Accordingly, Darien was thrown into prison, where she has remained for thirteen years.

In order to prevent Darien from revealing this dark secret, the new queen enchanted Darien's prison cell with the silence spell. Consequently, she has been unable to speak for over a decade. During that time, she has subsisted on the stories and scraps that her stimfay companion brings to her. She dreams of exacting vengeance on the medusae, and she trains every day in her cell, looking forward to the opportunity.

# Roleplaying Darien

## Spirited

Darien has spent thirteen years trapped in a cell, listening to stories of grand adventure. She is restless and enthusiastic about the possibility of going on her own adventures. Once she achieves vengeance for her mother, she is eager to join the heroes on their quest and explore the world beyond her island.

## Shy

Darien has not had much human contact in the time that she's been trapped in her cell. She speaks haltingly and with some embarassment about her limited social skills. She has never seen a man before, and she regards them with detached curiosity. She may develop secret feelings for female heroes.
