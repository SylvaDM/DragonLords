Chondrus is a priest of Lutheria who works alongside the Order of Sydon to secure magical secrets and political influence for the Titans. He currently serves as the master of the Great Library in Yonder (Y14), though he occasionally makes trips to Mytros to oversee the Cult of Lutheria's activities in the city.

Chondrus was born an orphan in Stygian Row, where he was treated with suspicion, like most of his kind. Eventually, he was taken in by priests at the Temple of Lutheria, where he learned magic and came to view the Mistress of Death as his own personal saviour.

When Chondrus came of age, he dared to travel to the Nether Sea to see the Lady of Dreams in person. After many trials, he succeeded in joining her personal harem. He spent many years aboard Hypnos, enjoying the pleasures of Lutheria's garden, but eventually, she grew bored of him and cast him out. Ever since, he has sought to return to her good graces and re-join her in Hypnos.

He hopes to accomplish this ingratiating himself with the party and then betraying them at the first opportune moment in the Nether Sea. For example, he might encourage the party to investigate the Iron Prison Cube and then lock them inside once they've entered.

The only thing Chondrus likes more than being right is correcting other people when they're wrong. He relishes pointing out minor errors, and he makes a great show of b
