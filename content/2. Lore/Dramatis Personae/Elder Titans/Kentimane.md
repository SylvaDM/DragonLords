Kentimane is the husband of [[Thylea]]. When [[Thylea]] became the land that bears her name, Kentimane became the guardian of that land. [[Thylea]] is nurturing, but Kentimane is anger personified: he is the hurricane, the earthquake, the volcano. When [[Thylea]] needs defending, he gives little thought to those who are caught in the storm of the destruction that he summons.

When Kentimane is sleeping, his body still manifests throughout [[Thylea]]. Great stone arms protrude from the earth like huge trees. The arms make strange landmarks, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their placement across the landscape.

Awake, Kentimane can appear in two forms: in his lesser form, he is a head protruding from the ground. His eyes search for foes and his massive arms explode from the earth to attack them. In his full form, Kentimane appears as a titanic pillar of legs with dozens of arms protruding from the middle and dozens of heads at the top. Legends disagree on the point of his exact height, because his form is always shifting. Kentimane can summon more arms from the landscape around him to attack his foes from every direction.
