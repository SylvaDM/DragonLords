The goddess Thylea has given her name to the Forgotten Land and has taken the form of a gargantuan tree at the heart of the sacred forest. Her followers believe that her roots reach deep into the earth, holding the world in her eternal embrace. Although she is a generous, life-giving goddess, she has been silent since the dawn of time, and as a consequence, very little is known about her.

It is known that she created the land eons ago. She is the lost sister of some elder pantheon. Unlike her siblings, she wished to live apart from the mortal races and created Thylea as a refuge from civilization. It was to be a place where nature and fey magic could flourish, without the corrupting influences of mortal desires. Accordingly, she created her own pantheon of Titans, including the Twins, [[Sydon]] and [[Lutheria]]. Thylea granted [[Sydon]] dominion over the oceans and charged him with guarding the islands from any mortal intrusion. [[Lutheria]] was granted dominion over the forests, and she was charged with guarding the islands against other gods. Thylea, however, failed to anticipate the incredible burden that this would place on [[Lutheria]]â€™s mind. Gods and demons from other worlds have attempted to probe the islands for thousands of years, and over time, this has driven [[Lutheria]] mad.
