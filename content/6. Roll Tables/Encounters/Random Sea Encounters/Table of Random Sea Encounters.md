Roll a d20 for each day spent at sea. On a result of 11 or higher, the party encounters something. Roll d100 and consult the table below. Alternatively, you may choose something that seems to fit the party's situation.

Many of the encounters here can be avoided by offering up a sacrifice to the gods or to the encountered creature itself. The size of the sacrifice is dependent on the power of the creature facing the heroes.
