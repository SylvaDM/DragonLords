>You spot an island on the horizon, but it's nowhere to be found on any of your maps. Vibrant greenery grows atop the brown, scale-like rocks of the landmass. A solitary building hangs over a cliff by the shoreline, and several small ships are anchored at a nearby dock. A massive stone outcropping juts up from the end of the island nearest your ship.

The small building is a trading post run by a guild of aquatic creatures. The trading post is managed by **Shazum** (CN **marid**) and a tribe of twelve sea elves (**merfolk**). The sea elves look unlike anything else in Thylea, and they claim to be from other worlds than this one. Each of the sea elves may hail from a different fantasy world of your choice.

**Trading Post.** The sea elves’ trading stock is quite impressive, and they sell all common equipment from the 5th Edition Player’s Book. All of the weapons and armour have an exotic look, and the sea elves claim that they were imported from many different worlds. The marid has a stock of magical potions for sale:

| Potion | Cost | Number in Stock|
|----------------| -----------| -----------|
| *potion of animal friendship* | 100 gp | 8 |
| *potion of clairvoyance* | 1,000 gp | 5 |
| *potion of gaseous form* | 1,000 gp | 5 |
| *potion of healing* | 25 gp | 20 |
| *potion of greater healing* | 100gp | 8 |
| *potion of longevity* | 5,000 gp | 4 |
| *potion of vitality* | 2,500 gp | 3 |
| *potion of water breathing* | 100 gp | 25 |

Currently, a couple of small ships from Aresia are docked here. Twelve Aresians (LN **warrior monks**) are browsing the wares. Their captain (LN **martial master**) has no desire for trouble.

***The World Turtle.**** This nomadic island is actually a huge creature known as “the world turtle.” It is thought to be an elemental being from the dawn of time that swims through the deepest oceans of many worlds. The turtle is also thought to be the mother of all dragon turtles, as parts of its shell are said to break off and become fully grown **dragon turtles**. The world turtle will only stay in the heroes’ world for 1d4 hours before resuming its eternal journey through all the oceans of the multiverse. When the turtle departs, it fades into a heavy fog, and the heroes are forced to swim back to their ship.

If the heroes remain here for more than one hour, they will notice a half-dozen smaller islands nearby where there were none before. Read the following:

>Looking out to sea, you notice six small islands where there were none before. Each appears to be a smaller replica of the main island, hewn from the same brown rock. A tiny hut, built from various type of pink coral, stands at the center of one of the islands.

The secondary islands are actually **dragon turtles** come to pay respects to their mother before they head back into the depths of the ocean. All the dragon turtles ignore the heroes. One of them has a coral outcropping that looks like a dwelling, but it is entirely natural. Buried within it is a *trident of fish command*; the coral has grown up around it over several decades. If the party investigates the “hut,” they have ten rounds to get the treasure before the dragon turtle dives under water.

****Escaping the Turtle.*** If characters are on the back of the small turtle when it dives, they will be swept into a strong ocean current. They can swim out of the current with a successful DC15 Strength (Athletics) check. If they fail, they are swept away with the turtles and lose consciousness (unless they can breathe water). The lost hero awakens after 1 hour, on the shore of the closest island. One of the dragon turtles has gently grabbed the hero in its mouth and taken him or her to safety.
