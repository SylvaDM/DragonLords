> The clear blue skies darken with black storm clouds, and a strong wind buffets your ship. The waters before you begin to churn, and waves crash against the ship’s prow from what appears to be a nascent maelstrom. A set of whip-like tentacles, each the size of a small boat, emerge from the choppy waters followed by a huge reptilian head. The creature’s yellow eyes look upon you with a fiendish intelligence and malign curiosity.

The heroes have sailed into the domain of a **kraken**. It will not strike first, but its tentacles will crawl over the ship, investigating every inch by touch. The beast is Sydon’s enemy and, once it learns that the heroes are also Sydon’s enemies, it will end its apparent hostility.

If attacked, the Kraken uses *control weather* to summon a storm. It then rises out of the water and uses its *lightning storm* action. It uses its *tentacle* and *fling* actions to attack, but it will not swallow any of the heroes or crew. While attacking, it communicates telepathically, demanding to know why the heroes have trespassed in its realm. It will quickly become clear to the Kraken that the heroes are enemies of Sydon. Once it has learned this, it will will sink back into the depths. If the heroes never mention Sydon, it will stop attacking after three rounds. The heroes can also offer a sacrifice worth 1,000 gp to appease the Kraken.
