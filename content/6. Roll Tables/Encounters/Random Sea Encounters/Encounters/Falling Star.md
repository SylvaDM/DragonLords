>It is a clear night and the heavens are ablaze with stars and constellations, beautiful to look upon. The peace is broken when you catch sight of a falling star. Instead of streaking quickly across the sky, it grows larger and larger until the flaming ball seems like it might hit the ship. As it passes overhead, you can feel its heat. Some distance away, it crashes into the sea. 

After the star hits with water, its bright glow remains visible beneath the waves. The heroes can sail toward where the falling star fell: 

>Although now cooled by the seawater, the fallen star continues to give off an eerie light, making it's resting place easy to spot beneath the waves.

The heroes can go underwater to explore the star, but they will need some sort of *water breathing* ability or spell in order to swim down to the seabed. The fallen star is a meteorite made of a silvery ore. It can be recovered from the ocean with a successful **DC15 Strength (Athletics)** check. This *orb of star metal* can be used in the construction of magic items at the Mithral Forge.
