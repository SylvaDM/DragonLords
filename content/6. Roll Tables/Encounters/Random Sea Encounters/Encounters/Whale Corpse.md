>Your nose is suddenly assaulted by the smell of what might be thousands of rotting fish. Searching the area, you discover the floating remains of the largest whale you have ever seen. Sharks circle and gnaw at the carcass, looking like minnows in comparison to their enormous meal. The whale’s gullet is torn open, and something metallic gleams from inside it.

There are six **hunter sharks** in the water, one of which is an extra-large **giant shark** with maximum hit points, and it always does maximum damage with its bite attacks. It circles in the darkness below and has advantage on Hide checks. It attacks anyone who comes into the water.

The glimmering object inside the way appears to be a human corpse wearing a magical breastplate, the equivalent of mariner’s armour. One of the sharks ripping into the whale shifts the “corpse” so that it is no longer visible. If someone swims over to the whale carcass to search for the corpse they will find that it isn’t a corpse, but an old man named **Aegis** (LN **veteran**). He claims to have been living inside the whale for years. If the party is willing to take him onboard, he will fight alongside them. Aegis tells all sorts of tall tales about Thylea, most of which are of his own invention
