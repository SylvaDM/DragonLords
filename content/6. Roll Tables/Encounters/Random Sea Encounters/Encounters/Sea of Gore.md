>Your ship sails into a patch of deep crimson water that stretches on as far as the eye can see. Gory chunks of sea creatures, as well as the occasional humanoid corpse, float in the waves. Worse than the sight of all the carnage is the pervasive stench of rotting flesh, and the coppery tang of blood.

The gore-filled bloody water is a patch of sea about a mile across. There are half-eaten whales, sharks, dolphins, and even merfolk. Anyone sailing towards the middle of the area will find that the water becomes increasingly shallow, and the sea bottom is only about 20 feet down. This central lump in the seabed is the nesting ground of a dreadful **hydra**. It eventually rises to the surface and attacks everyone who is on deck. This hydra is far bigger than most, with seven heads and maximum hit points. It can be distracted for 1 round by feeding it a sacrificial animal, but three full rounds are required to escape from the creature.
