>A small, half-wrecked boat approaches your ship. Three voluptuous, barely-clothed young women stand in the boat, their features obscured by long, luminous hair. Upon noticing your party, they begin to sing an entrancing song—an invitation to join them.

These creatures are actually a coven of **sea hags**. They use magic to take the form of whatever creature is most alluring to your players—for example, they might be handsome men instead of voluptuous women.

The hags have a different spell selection from a normal coven:
- 1st level (4 slots): *ray of sickness*, *shield*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *hold person*, *locate object*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *bestow curse*, *counterspell*, *lightning bolt*
- 4th level (3 slots): *phantasmal killer*, *polymorph*
- 5th level (2 slots): *contact other plane*, *scrying*
- 6th level (1 slots): *mass suggestion*
- 
The hags cast their mass suggestion spell in the form of a song. It urges all sailors to swim over to them to enjoy their company. As those affected swim closer, they quickly realize that the creatures aren’t quite as beautiful as they initially seemed. They have shapely bodies, but their faces have warts, their hair is greasy and thin, and their finger nails are caked in dirt.

The hags *polymorph* their victims into crabs and stuff them into bags. Then they swim over to the ship and climb aboard while resuming their true forms, so as to horrify anyone on deck with their *horrific appearance*. They then use their *death glare* and attempt to slaughter everyone aboard the ship.
