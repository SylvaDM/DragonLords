> The horizon changes, and seems to rise up. A huge wave is approaching your ship. Your crew scrambles to prepare, but it soon becomes apparent that this wave is caused by something massive that moves beneath the water. The wave towers above your ship, blotting out the sun. Your ship begins to ride up the swell...

**Kentimane** walks through the oceans of Thylea, and this wave passes before him. He is hunting for trespassing ships from the outer world. Luckily, the partyâ€™s ship is a Thylean vessel and therefore not his target.

The only way to avoid the wave is through magic. Spells such as *gust of wind*, *wind wall*, or a *conjured air elemental* will allow the Ultros to speed away from the wave. Without magic, they will have to ride it out. As they reach a point half-way up the wave, the distorted shadow of Kentimane appears inside the water:

>As your ship climbs the monumental wave, the shadow of a gargantuan creature can be seen darkening the water. It appears to be a titanic humanoid with dozens of writhing arms and heads. Whatever this giant may be, it seems unaware of your vessel. Eventually, your ship rides back down the wave, and the ocean calms.

Kentimane will ignore the *Ultros* and the heroes should be able to continue on their way unharmed. If they are suicidal enough to attack Kentimane, his statistics can be found in the Dramatis Personae appendix.
