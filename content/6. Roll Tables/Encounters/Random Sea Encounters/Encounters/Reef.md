>A scraping noise can be heard coming from the port side of your ship, and the ship heels over and turns sharply to port. It seems that you've hit a coral reef and run aground. None of the sailors saw any indication that the reef was there. Fortunately, the coral has not pierced the ship’s hull—but you appear to be stuck.

The only way to get the ship unstuck is to use magic or to push the ship until it is free of the reef. It takes a combined Strength of 40 to push the ship off of the reef. It takes 10 rounds to push the ship free. Each round, those pushing the ship must make DC 15 Strength saving throws or slip on the sharp coral. Anyone who slips takes 1 point of damage, but more importantly, they start bleeding into the water.

***Shark Attack.*** One round after someone bleeds into the water, fins can be seen breaking the waves: sharks! There will be one **reef shark** per bleeding character. Fortunately, the sharks are too big to swim into the shallow waters of the reef. However, five rounds later, a tribe of six **merrow** attack. The merrow use their harpoons to drag any character they strike into deeper water where the **reef sharks** can reach them. There is one reef shark for each character dragged from the reef. The merrow attacks continue until they have succeeded in killing one character, or for three rounds after the ship is freed.
