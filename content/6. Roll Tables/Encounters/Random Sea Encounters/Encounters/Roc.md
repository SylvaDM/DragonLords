>A distant speck appears in the sky above the horizon. You recognize the silhouette of a flying bird, but this one appears to be enormous in size. As it draws closer, your entire ship is cast into shadow. The gargantuan creature begins circling the ship as it slowly descends. The powerful downdraft from its massive wings makes it challenging to stand upright on the deck.

The **roc** is from *Aerie of the Roc* in the Forgotten Sea. It is hunting for food for its young. It swoops down and tries to snatch up a character from the deck. It will make three attempts before giving up. Leaving any large sacrificial animal on deck as a target will attract its attention, and it will gladly take such a sacrifice. If it does manage to grapple one of the crew, it will carry the victim back to its nest to feed its chicks. The victim has three attempts to escape the grapple, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw. The victim takes 2d6 damage from falling into the sea.

***The Roc's Nest.*** Any character who is taken back to the nest will be dumped in front of the rocâ€™s three chicks. The roc will fly off, leaving the victim for its chicks to tear apart and devour. The chicks have the statistics of **giant vultures** with no fly speed.

>Note:
>>The heroes should be encouraged to sail after the roc to rescue their shipmate. They can follow the giant bird instead of using the Antikythera to navigate.
