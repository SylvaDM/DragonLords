>The screeches of six monstrous flying creatures above your ship interrupt an otherwise peaceful day. Great feline beasts circle overhead on scaly reptilian wings. Uncanny, human-like faces protrude from wild manes edged with barbed quills. When they see that you have noticed them, their howls morph into malicious insults, delivered in perfect common speech.

The six **manticores** will stay at least 200 feet away from the ship and taunt anyone they can see. They will then demand a living sacrifice to Sydon. Any large animal will do, but they don’t explain that detail: don’t correct players thinking that a human sacrifice is required if they leap to that conclusion. If no sacrifice is offered, the manticores will choose someone on the deck (most likely a popular NPC) and use their tail spikes to incapacitate them. One manticore will fly in to pick up the victim as the necessary sacrifice. The manticores will retreat as soon as one of their number has been killed, promising to exact brutal vengeance on the heroes. It is at your discretion whether they ever return to take their vengeance.
