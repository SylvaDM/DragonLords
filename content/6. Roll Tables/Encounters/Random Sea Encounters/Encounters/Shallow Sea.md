>Your ship sails into waters that are curiously transparent, and the white sand of the seabed is clearly visible. As you sail on, the sea grows shallower and you notice what appears to be a dense coral forest. However, a closer look reveals that the  colourful forest below your keel is an undersea village of some kind. Merfolk wave up at your ship in welcome.

The merfolk are very curious about the party and their crew. Some of them swim to the surface to greet the party and invite them down into their village.

All of the merfolk have the amphibious trait and swim speed of 40 ft. A mermaid named **Iolaah** (CG merfolk **druid**) asks questions about the party's origins and purpose in this part of the ocean. If the heroes reveal their quest, Iolaah will become very interested and will want to take them to meet her father, Hywin.

**Hywin** (NG merfolk **archmage**) resides in a beautiful translucent coral sphere. He is an enemy of Sydon, and he is willing to help anyone who opposes the Titan. He knows the entire history of Sydon and Lutheria and is willing to tell the tale. Afterwards, he breaks off a piece of coral for each character that has come to see him. These simultaneously act as potions of waterbreathing and heroism on anyone who swallows them. He wishes the party well on their quest.

Iolaah wishes to accompany the characters, but Hywin will forbid it. He tells the characters that Iolaah is impetuous and young and not ready for such an adventure. An hour after the ship sails away from the merfolk, a single dolphin swims alongside the ship. It transforms into Iolaah. She climbs aboard the ship and asks to accompany the heroes on their quest.

If the party refuses, she will be disappointed and she returns home safely. Otherwise, she joins the party on their quest. Iolaah is extraordinarily reckless in battle and unlikely to survive for very long. If she dies during the quest, Hywin will hold the party responsible. He may seek vengeance upon the heroes later.

>Note:
>>Iolaah's Statistics
Iolaah has the statistics of a **druid**, but she has the additional power to shapeshift:
***Shapechanger.*** Iolaah can use her action to polymorph herself into a human or a dolphin. Her statistics are the same in each form, but she loses her swim speed in human form. She can use another action to return to her merfolk form.
