>You notice rumblings in the ground beneath your feet, just seconds before a gigantic, one-eyed woman bursts from the foliage nearby. The cyclops roars in laughter, shaking her great club at you. She then gleefully heads your way with a malevolent gleam in her eye.

A female **cyclops** has decided that the heroes would make an excellent sacrifice to Sydon, once they are smashed into pulp. She is easy to trick, and the heroes can try to convince her that they are agents of the gods, or gods themselves in disguise. A successful **DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion)** check will convince her to leave the party alone. If she easily “smashes” the heroes (knocks down half their number), she will feel sorry for them. Such weaklings are not worth sacrificing, and she will spare them if they beg for their “little” lives.
