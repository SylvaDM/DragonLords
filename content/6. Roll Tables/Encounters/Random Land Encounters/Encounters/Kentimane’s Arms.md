>A pair of enormous stone forearms reach out of the ground next to the path that you are following. The statues are completely still, frozen in a gesture that appears to be grasping at the sky. Although the stonework appears to be finely carved, there are no other signs of civilization or any man-made structures anywhere in the vicinity.

The pair of giant stone arms are normally inactive, unless the heroes have killed either Sydon or Lutheria. In that case, Kentimane has begun to awaken, and the **Hands of Kentimane** will attack with the intent to destroy the party!
