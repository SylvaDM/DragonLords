>You hear the sounds of angry shouting just beyond a nearby hedge. Peering through, you can see a strange, headless creature with a single great eye and mouth on its chest. The cyclops appears to be screaming at itself and cursing its own stupidity. It stands over a broken human body and clutches at the lifeless arms.

This lonely **blemys** recently befriended a traveling merchant. The two got on very well for several months until the cyclops lost his temper and killed his new friend. Now he deeply regrets it. He notices the party immediately and vents his anger on them, believing that they will try to kill him, because he's “just a stupid monster.” Unless the party can use *raise dead* or some other spell to resurrect his friend, the blemys will attack the party and try to drive them away, weeping the whole time.
