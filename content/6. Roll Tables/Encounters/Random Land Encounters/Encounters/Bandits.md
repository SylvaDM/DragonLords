> A group of men and women, all suffering from serious-looking and apparently recent wounds, approaches your party. One man at the front of the band motions for his fellows to stop and calls out to you for aid.


A group of badly-wounded bandits are looking for help. They tried to waylay a band of centaurs, but the ambush went poorly. There are 7 (2d6) **bandits**and a **bandit captain**. All have been reduced to half hit points. The bandit captain tries to convince the heroes to join forces with them before the centaur band arrives.

Five **centaurs** arrive 10 minutes later. If the bandits are alive when the centaurs appear, the heroes must make a **DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion)** check to convince the centaurs that they have nothing to do with the bandits. If the bandits are dead, then the Persuasion check is only DC 10. If the heroes team up with the bandits to defeat the centaurs, the bandit captain rewards the heroes with **50 gp** and a **potion of healing**.
