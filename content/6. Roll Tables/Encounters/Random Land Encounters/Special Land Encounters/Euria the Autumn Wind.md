>The road grows rocky as you enter a mountainous region. In the distance, a ruined guard tower stands at a vantage point, which obviously has clear views of the whole surrounding area. The building looks ancient, and it's in a very poor state of repair. There looks to be a fire burning on the parapet, and you can hear gentle music drifting from inside. 

**Euria** (CN **oread**) lives inside the guard tower, and is play­ing music upon a Euros lyre. The mountain nymph has a permanently charmed **fire elemental** acting as a beacon at the top of the tower. Euria is radiantly beautiful, and she wears nothing except a *cloak of protection*. She is polite and welcoming to travellers, but she is largely uninterested in why the heroes have come to her tower. She openly admires them as strong and powerful adventurers, though.

>Note:
>>The Four Winds: Euria
>>> Kyrah recognizes Euria as one of the Four Winds, fey bards who stole musical instruments from the Temple of the Five. The Euros lyre rightfully belongs to Kyrah. In any fight, there is a 75% chance that the lyre will be destroyed in the battle, leaving behind a set of *nymph-hair strings*. 

### The Nymph's Desire
#
Euria wants to lure travellers into her tower so that she may turn them into thralls. She prefers her victims to be willing, and she will offer to take one of the heroes to "paradise:• If a hero agrees, she will spend the night with them. By morning, they have be under the effects of a *geas spell* (with no chance to save).

If Euria successfully puts one of the heroes under her geas, then she demands that they bring her the *Boreal harp*. She's grown tired of the lyre and wants something new to play. She explains that the satyrs who tend to the Mytros vineyards took the harp. Another one could be crafted at the *Mithral Forge*. If the heroes perform this task respectfully, then she will exchange her *Euros lyre* for the *Boreal harp* and free her thrall from the geas. 


### Treasure

Inside the guard tower is a chest containing many ancient, withered iron swords. The swords are worthless other than as a source of iron, but they bear inscriptions that date their original forging to the First War.
