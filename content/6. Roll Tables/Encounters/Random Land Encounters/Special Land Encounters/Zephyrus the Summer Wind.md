>You feel a warm summery breeze. It guides you into a forest clearing, which is carpeted by wildflowers. There are ancient marble collapsed ruins here which are apparently guarded by an animated mound of thorny vines and laurel leaves. The vine creature sways back and forth as if dancing, while sitting upon one of the fallen pillars is a satyr playing a gentle tune upon a lute.

**Zephyrus** (CN **satyr minstrel**) is playing a Zephyr lute, and has permanently charmed the **shambling mound** that is dancing to his music. Neither he nor the sham­bling mound will attack unless they are provoked, but they will not permit the heroes to explore the ruins. The satyr has a wicked sense of humour, and not above passing comment on the heroes, their apparent prowess (in all fields of endeavour), their clothes, their equip­ment, their haircuts, their weaponry ("That's a very tiny sword ...") and anything else he finds funny. 

>Note:
>>The Four Winds: Zephyrus
>>> Kyrah recognizes Zephyrus as one of the Four Winds, a troupe of fey bards who broke into the Temple of the Five and stole her divine instruments, including the Zephyr lute. In any fight, Zephyrus will use the lute as a make­shift club (doing ld4 bludgeoning damage) and there is a 75% chance that the lute will be destroyed in the process, leaving behind a set *nymph-hair strings*. 


### The Shrine Guardian
#
Zephyrus claims to be the guardian of the ruin, which was once a shrine to Helios, the sun god. Helios has been largely forgotten by the mortals in Thylea, but he is still revered by the giants and fey folks. Zephyrus will ask the heroes if they would like to hear a song about the god. If the heroes agree, he will then lull them to sleep with a gentle, tragic melody about a mortal who stole the sun god's chariot and flew too close to the sun. 

When the heroes awaken, they have been restrained by entangling vines, which require a DC 15 Strength saving throw to escape. The satyr will apologize, but he cannot allow the location of the shrine to be discovered. He will then order the shambling mound to smash the heroes into very small bits. 

### Treasure

Hidden under the ruins is a golden statue of the sun god, a beautiful man with long hair, worth 1,000 gp. There is also a sealed clay tube. This is a scroll case that must be shattered to open it. Inside are three *fireball* scrolls.
