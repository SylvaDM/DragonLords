>You hear the clatter of uneven hoof beats approach­ing from behind. You turn to find a centaur stumbling towards you, carrying an empty wineskin. Despite his wobbly gait, the centaur does not appear to be angry or particularly distressed. When he notices you, he smiles drunkenly and flexes his meaty arms. He seems to be in the mood for a friendly challenge.

This drunken centaur is **Pholon** (refer to Dramatis Personae for details). He will challenge the hero that seems toughest to him to a fist fight. He'll also agree to wrestle anyone who seems up to it. He'll fight until a com­batant is reduced to zero hit points, but he won't inflict any serious harm; his preferred fighting methods are grappling and punching. 

Whatever the outcome of this fight, Pholon will decide that the heroes are his kind of people. He explains that he is from Scorpion Island. He recently lost his mortal rider, and he's looking for a new bonded brother or sister. This is a chance for the heroes to pick up a new companion and quite a useful mount.
