The inscription on the tomb reads:

	ESTOR ARKELANDER
	Oathsworn of Kyrah

>Disturbing images adorn the walls of this tomb. Rather than heroic battles, the carvings largely depict a man slaughtering unarmed dryads and satyrs in gory detail. Clear pain and fear mark his victims’ faces. In one panel, his dragon companion appears to beg for mercy on behalf of a group of nearby creatures. A blood-red marble sarcophagus bearing the same man’s image sits in the centre of the room.

Estor Arkelander was the brother of Telamok, and one of the original Dragonlords who came to Thylea five centuries ago. His body was never interred here. He still captains the doomed ghost ship, the *Ultros*, as the heroes will discover later in the story.

### Kyrah's Reaction
Kyrah reacts coldly to the tomb. She still carries centuries of guilt about the atrocities committed by Estor during the First War. She has nothing to say about the tomb, and she has no desire to linger here any longer than she has to.

## Treasure
Estor's sarcophagus is empty.
