The inscription on the tomb reads:

	MYRTO THE MAGNIFICENT

>Two identical clay statues of a handsome man stand on either side of a grey marble sarcophagus, which is carved with the same likeness. He can also be seen throughout the tomb’s murals, which depict him as a man of immense wealth. Inlays of gold, silver, and precious stones glitter from the murals, all in sharp contrast to the fading colours that surround them.

Myrto was the grandson of Adonis. He used his family wealth to bribe the other Dragonlords, so that he would be elected leader after the death of Cosmo. The two statues of Myrto that flank his sarcophagus are **clay golems** that will attack anyone who enters the tomb.

## Treasure
Myrto’s decorative breastplate and shield are useless in battle. They are forged from silver, gold, and platinum. They are worth 2,500 gp each. This tomb is not consecrated.
