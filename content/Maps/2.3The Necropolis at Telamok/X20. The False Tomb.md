>This circular chamber has a domed ceiling with an oculus that lets in some light from above. The chamber is dominated by a large stone sarcophagus engraved with gilded letters. The floor at the foot of the sarcophagus is covered by an old but beautifully-woven rug. The rug depicts Xander conquering a race of bull-headed minotaurs. One of the creatures kneels at Xander’s feet with a peace offering held above his head.

The inscription on the sarcophagus is written in **Draconic**, and it reads

	XANDER HUORATH
	FIRST OF HIS ORDER

This room is a false tomb, and a trap for those who would loot Xander’s treasures. The sarcophagus is a **mimic** and the rug is an **animated rug**. The first person to touch the sarcophagus will become stuck to it because of the mimic’s adhesive ability. The rug and mimic will then attack with surprise.

There is nothing of value here. The lever at the back resets the trap in *The Trap (X23)*. Whenever it is pulled, there is a screeching sound of metal against metal.
