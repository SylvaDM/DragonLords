The inscription on the tomb reads:

	RIZON PHOBAS
	Oathsworn of Volkan

>This tomb is lined with murals of grand battles. The murals feature an imposing woman riding a bronze dragon. The main panel depicts the heroic warrior triumphing over a group of formidable-looking minotaurs. Six minotaur skeletons are arranged like guardians around the sarcophagus, which has been painted with the likeness of the woman from the murals.

Rizon, a rival of Xander, was one of the riders who came to Thylea five centuries ago. She was largely responsible for the defeat of the minotaur armies in the First War. Her tomb is guarded by 6 **minotaur skeletons**. They stand guard beside her sarcophagus and will attack anyone who enters the chamber.

## Treasure
Rizonâ€™s mithral breastplate and shield are worth 500 gp each. She also holds a *mithral kopis +1*. This tomb is consecrated, so taking any of these items will afflict the thief with the *curse of the grave robber*.
