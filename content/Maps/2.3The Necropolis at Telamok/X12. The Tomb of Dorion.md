The inscription on the tomb reads:

	DORION NEURDAGON

>Soot darkens the floor and walls of this tomb. An ornate sarcophagus in the centre of the room is carved with the likeness of a young man, and its lid has been left slightly ajar. Footprints in the soot suggest that this crypt has been visited in the recent past.

Dorion Neurdagon was the last of his family to take up the mantle of Dragonlord. His tomb has been looted. The soot on the walls is from a fire-based trap that no longer works. Damon resealed the tomb long ago, but he could do nothing more. Dorionâ€™s body is missing its head, and there is no treasure in the sarcophagus.
