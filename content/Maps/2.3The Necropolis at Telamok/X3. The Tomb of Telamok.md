The inscription on the tomb reads:

	TELAMOK ARKELANDER
	Oathsworn of Vallus

> The inside of the crypt contains a large sarcophagus with a proud warrior engraved on its lid. Fading murals cover the walls and ceiling of the crypt. They depict the same warrior, slaughtering enemies of every kind: men, women, centaurs, satyrs, cyclopes, and more.

Telamok was a particularly vicious Dragonlord, known for never giving quarter in battle. He was responsible for some of the worst massacres during the First War, and was cursed to undeath as a result.

### Telamok's Sarcophagus
If his sarcophagus is opened, Telamok will rise as a **wight**. He has maximum hit points (66) and is dressed in a breastplate with a shield (AC 18). He has a Strength of 20. He will pursue anyone who breaks into his tomb for one minute. Afterwards, he will return to his tomb and reseal it.

## Treasure
Telamokâ€™s mithral breastplate and shield are worth 500 gp each. They are engraved with elaborate dragon motifs. This tomb is not consecrated.
