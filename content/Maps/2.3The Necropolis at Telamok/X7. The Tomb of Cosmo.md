The inscription on the tomb reads:

	COSMO PHOBAS
	Son of Rizon Phobas

>Your torchlight seems unable to properly illuminate the floor, ceiling, and walls, which are covered in a slick black substance that appears to shift and quiver. The only object you can clearly make out is a grey marble sarcophagus with the features of a man.

Cosmo was the first-born son of Rizon. He succeeded Xander as the leader of the Dragonlords.

The interior walls, floor, and ceiling of the tomb are black in colour and appear to be alive. This is because they are coated with five **black puddings**, one on each wall (but not the entrance wall) and one on the ceiling and floor. They will attack anyone who enters.

## Treasure
Cosmoâ€™s adamantine breastplate and shield are worth 500 gp each. This tomb is not consecrated.
