>This white marble tomb is carved into the side of the mountain and sheltered by an imposing portico of weathered columns. The entrance to the sepulchre is blocked by a heavy, chiselled slab, flanked by two statues of sitting lions. The centre of the slab is fitted with an inset bronze handle. The pediment above the tomb is engraved with the name “XANDER” amidst intricate vines and laurel leaves.

Xander’s tomb is sealed with a marble door that has an inset bronze handle. It can be pulled open with a successful **DC 15 Strength check**.

### Lesser Tombs
Four lesser tombs are adjacent to Xander's, for his closest companions and friends. Each one is sealed by a block of marble measuring 5 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and 5 feet thick. Removing or resetting one of these blocks requires an action and a successful **DC 25 Strength check**. There are three names inscribed on the tombs—Aetius, Pericles, and Eustace.

The last tomb is unlabelled and empty, because it was built for Damon but never used. Inside the three tombs, the bodies of Aetius, Pericles, and Eustace are all equipped with steel breastplates, shields, and short swords. All of the items are in perfect condition, but none are magical.
