The inscription on the tomb reads:

	OCHOS ARKELANDER

> A bronze statue of a man stands watch over this tomb. The murals on the walls of this tomb depict the man leading an army of hoplites in several clashes against the centaurs in the grasslands north of the Arkelon River. The man is shown wearing a simple bronze breastplate, and his sarcophagus is entirely unadorned.

Ochos is another in the Arkelander family, but he was a soldier rather than a king. A bronze statue of Ochos stands behind the sarcophagus. This bronze statue is actually a **golem**. Although the golem is made of bronze, it has all the statistics of an **iron golem** except that its AC is 18 rather than 20. The golem attacks anyone who removes an item from this tomb.

## Treasure
Ochos wears a *breastplate +2*. He has also has a bronze short sword and a shield worth 250 gp each. This tomb is not consecrated.
