The inscription on the tomb reads:

	LYSIS ARKELANDER

>The walls of the tomb display the brutal behaviour of a king with a glint of madness in his eye. The main panel shows his downfall at the hands of the god, Pythor. At the centre of the tomb is a black marble sarcophagus carved in the image of the mad king.

Lysis was the great grandson of Estor, and he was the last of his family to rule Estoria. The Arkelanders had ruled Estoria as kings for over a century, but Lysis proved to be a mad tyrant who stained the throne with wanton murder and torture. The god Pythor, unable to stand by and watch, overthrew him and took the throne.

## Treasure
Lysisâ€™s bronze breastplate and shield are inscribed with platinum and are worth 500 gp each. This tomb is not consecrated.
