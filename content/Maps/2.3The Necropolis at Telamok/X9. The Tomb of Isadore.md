The inscription reads:

	ISADORE HUORATH

>The sarcophagus of this crypt depicts an athletic woman of regal bearing. Murals in the tomb show her competing in foot races, javelin throwing, and other competitive games. Always at her side is a man in a cloak that resembles the one worn by the lich that guards the Necropolis.

Isadore was the granddaughter of Xander. Damon served as her chief advisor when she ruled the Dragonlords. After she died, Damon retreated from life in the city of Mytros and came to the Necropolis to be its guardian, and to watch over Isadore in particular. 

### Damon's Alarm
Damon has the *alarm* spell cast on the tomb. If anyone opens the tomb, the alarm goes off and the sound of a bell ringing will be heard. Spellcasters will recognize the sound as the *alarm* spell with a successful **DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check**. A **DC 15 check or higher** will reveal that Damon was the likely caster.

Three rounds after the *alarm* spell goes off, Damon will *teleport* in and use his full range of powers to destroy anyone still trespassing inside the tomb.

## Treasure
Isadore wears a necklace worth 1000 gp and five rings worth 200 gp each. Beside her body lies a *staff of charming*. This tomb is consecrated, so taking the staff will afflict the thief with the *curse of the grave robber*.
