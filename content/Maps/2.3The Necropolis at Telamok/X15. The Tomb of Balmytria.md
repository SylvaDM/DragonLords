>This massive tomb dwarfs all of the others in the Necropolis. The pristine white marble mausoleum is supported by immense, serpentine pillars. As you draw closer, you realize that these pillars are actually statues that have been carved in the shapes of dragons.

This is the largest tomb in the Necropolis, as befits the burial place of a dragon. Some believe that it houses a passageway to the Underworld.

## Investigation: Tomb Interior

>Unlike most of the art in the Necropolis, the mosaics that line the walls and ceilings here are pristine, almost new in appearance. The panel closest to the entrance depicts five majestic dragons, one silver and four bronze, soaring through the heavens. A formidable human warrior is mounted on each dragon.

>The next mosaic is dominated by the verdant coast of Thylea. While the bronze dragons remain aloft, the silver dragon is shown making landfall on this new continent. Her rider greets a haggard-looking group of humans on the shore. Subsequent mosaics show human civilization on the continent blossoming from tiny towns to great walled cities under the leadership of the Dragonlords.

A huge marble block rests at the center of the mausoleum. This is where the body of Balmytria is interred. The block is 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 5 feet high. The block cannot be moved except by one of the Titans or by the Five Gods, but none are willing to disturb the resting place of Balmytria.
