The inscription reads:

	GREGOR HUORATH

>This crypt is empty and has no sarcophagus. The murals and painted ceiling tell the story of a young man traversing the islands and waters of Thylea. The man, however, is absent from the final panel. This simply shows a grieving woman looking across a stormy sea from a palace balcony.

Unlike the other tombs, this tomb does not have marble pillars. The body of Gregor of the Huorath family was never found. Although his tomb was prepared, it has always been empty.
