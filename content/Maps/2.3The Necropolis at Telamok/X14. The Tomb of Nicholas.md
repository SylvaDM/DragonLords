The inscription on the tomb reads:

	NICHOLAS PHOBAS
	Blessed of Sydon

>This tomb is in good condition compared to most of the others. The murals are bright and the paint has not completely faded. The images adorning the walls and sarcophagus depict a man who is equal parts sailor and king. He wears a breastplate adorned with a maelstrom swirl, the symbol of Sydon.

Nicholas was the very last of the Dragonlords. He ruled and died one century ago, though the order had long been corrupted at that point. In his lifetime, Nicholas swore fealty to Sydon as a symbolic gesture of peace, earning the blessing of the Titan. The Order of Sydon modeled themselves after his example.

### Teleportation Trap
This sarcophagus is protected by magic, and anyone touching it must make a **DC 15 Charisma saving throw** or be teleported to Sydonâ€™s *Throne Room in Praxys (S28)* for 1 minute.

Sydon knows that whoever appears before him was desecrating the tomb of Nicholas Phobas, and he will use his full power to destroy the impudent tomb raider. If anyone survives this encounter, they are immediately teleported back to the tomb. Once activated, this trap cannot be activated again for a full year.

## Treasure
Nicholas has a bronze breastplate and a platinum shield inscribed with the symbol of Sydon. Each is worth 1,500 gp. There is also a single *mithral ingot* worth 500 gp.
