> This room stinks of blood and offal. Animal carcasses and slabs of meat hang from the ceiling on heavy chains. Two of the hanging bodies appear to be those of human farmers. The stone floor is stained black by centuries of the minotaur’s bloody appetites. This appears to be his lair

This room is Graxis’ lair. He goes hunting once a month and stores his kills in here. His curse prevents him from sleeping, so there is no place for him to rest. It is possible for heroes to set up an ambush here for Graxis.

## Treasure
Graxis keeps baubles and coins that he has taken from those he has hunted and killed. In a bag he has 600 cp, 254 sp, 115 gp, and six pieces of jewellery worth 25 gp each.
