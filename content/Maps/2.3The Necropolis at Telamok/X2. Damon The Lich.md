> A lone skeletal figure stands at the centre of this bridge. A tattered cloak covers the figure's thin frame and obscures its face. Golden runes are traced along the hems of the cloak. As you draw closer, the figure holds out a skeletal hand expectantly, as if awaiting some sort of payment.

**Damon** (TN *lich*) was a companion of the original Dragonlords who sailed across the ocean to Thylea. He lost everything in the First War, including his wife and children. He dedicated his life to the defence of the settlers, and now he defends the Necropolis to honour those who sacrificed their lives to do the same.

He is now a lich. The Necropolis is considered to be his lair, and he would be an incredibly difficult opponent for the heroes. He may use spells such as *hold person* and *wall of force* to prevent a battle, if the heroes are stupid enough to attack him.

Damon will only allow the party to pass the bridge if he is given a single *burnished dragonlord coin*.

Anyone who tries to fly to the Necropolis without payment will be targeted by Damon. The one creature that Damon allows to pass at will is Graxis the minotaur
