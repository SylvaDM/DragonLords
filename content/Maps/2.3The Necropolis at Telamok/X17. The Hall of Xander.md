> This expansive hall is dark and wet. Stone archways hold up the ceiling, and empty torch brackets line the walls at regular intervals. The floor descends in wide steps of interlocking stone. At the rear of the hall, a stairwell leads down into the lower reaches of the tomb. Guarding the stairwell is a bronze statue of a kneeling, bull-headed minotaur.

> The walls are covered by colourful mosaics depicting ancient battles against centaurs, cyclopes, and six-armed gygans. The Dragonlord Xander is shown hewing the head from a basilisk with a mighty swing of his axe. He is shown with three warrior companions

This hall has mosaics that illustrate the history of Xander and the Dragonlords who came to Thylea five centuries ago. The initial mosaics show great kings and queens granting Xander and his companions the ships and money needed to embark on a great voyage of discovery. Next, they show the five dragons making an alliance with Xander. The central mosaics show the discovery of Thylea, while the final ones detail the war of conquest against the inhabitants of Thylea, including the centaurs, minotaurs, and gygans.

An inscription above the stairs reads: “Those who trespass in order to seek an audience with Xander Hourath must deal with the horned ones.”
