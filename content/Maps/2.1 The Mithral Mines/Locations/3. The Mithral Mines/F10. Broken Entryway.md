> Ahead of you, the natural passage breaks into a tunnel of what looks to be dwarven construction. A stone bridge crosses overhead, and a narrow 5-foot-wide ledge leads up to it. The bridge is apparently guarded by a statue of a large, two-headed dog.

The tunnel extends into the deep shaft where the mithral and adamantine can be found. Centuries ago, dwarves discovered the veins of the valuable minerals while exploring the natural caverns. The statue is a **death dog** that was petrified by a cockatrice. It awakens from its petrification 10 minutes after the heroes arrive.
