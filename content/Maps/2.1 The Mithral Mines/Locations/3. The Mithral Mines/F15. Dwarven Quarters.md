> Rotting bunk beds and chests make it obvious that this chamber was living quarters, of sorts.

The dwarves took most of their possessions when they fled. The troglodytes have looted almost everything else, but there are a few valuables that can be scavenged.

### Room One
There is a sack buried underneath the rotting furniture. It contains 65 sp.

### Room Two
There is nothing of value in this room.

### Room Three
One of the dwarven skeletons has a ring with an amethyst worth 250 gp.
