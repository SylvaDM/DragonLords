>This square chamber seems to have been used as a pen for some sort of animals, but whatever was here has escaped. Cages made from petrified wood lay broken or open. A statue of a troglodyte stands in the middle of the room, along with a statue of a two-headed dog. Scattered about the room are about a half-dozen corpses of what appear to be chickens.

There is a single **cockatrice** running around loose, and it attacks the heroes. If the heroes wait around in this room for more than one minute, the **death dogâ€™s** petrification ends and it also attacks.

These pens are used by the troglodytes to keep a flock of cockatrices. The troglodyte king enjoys breeding them and fighting them against each other. He also uses the cockatrices to petrify prisoners so that they can be preserved for later consumption. Sometimes he serves a cooked cockatrice to 'honoured guests.'

Just a few days ago, the death dogs from the lower levels started exploring the upper levels. The dogs killed the troglodytes in this room, but one of the troglodytes let the cockatrices loose as a last resort. The cockatrices ran amok. Some were eaten by the death dogs while others used their power to petrify the beasts.
