> This massive hall is supported by a series of pillars, many of which have been broken. The corpse of a gargantuan three-headed dog is splayed out in the centre of the room. Several two-headed hounds chew away at the flesh of this rotting corpse. The skeletal remains of dwarves are scattered everywhere

There are three **death dogs** in this room. They attack and fight to the death. The Cerberus appears to have been killed by something massive, which must have come up from [[F17. The Deep Shaft|the Deep Shaft (F17)]].

### Treasure
One of the dwarven skeletons wears a mithral chain shirt. There are 25 dwarven skeletons. Their skulls may be returned to the dwarves at [[E8. The Dragonâ€™s Tooth|The Dragon's Tooth (E8) ]]for proper burial.
