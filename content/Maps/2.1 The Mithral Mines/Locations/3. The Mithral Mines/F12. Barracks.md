>This room looks like the scene of a recent battle. There are several half-eaten troglodyte corpses in one corner. Three statues of two-headed dogs stand at the centre of the room. There are also several rotting wooden racks that might have once been used for weapons and armour.

There are two **cockatrices** in this room. They attack when the heroes enter. The three **death dog** statues will awaken from their petrification 10 minutes after the heroes arrive. The death dogs awaken one at a time, every two rounds.
