> This area seems to be a den of sorts. Straw mats lie along the edges of the cave, and they are covered in filth. The floor is littered with the bones of humans, centaurs, and other creatures.

This cluster of tunnels and caves are where most of the troglodytes dwell. The warrens are normally the resting place for dozens of the creatures, but when the heroes arrive, most of them are elsewhere. Two **troglodytes** and two **troglodyte brutes** currently sleep in the caves. If they hear the heroes coming, the troglodytes will hide along the walls or in their own filth on the floors, preparing an ambush as the heroes investigate.
