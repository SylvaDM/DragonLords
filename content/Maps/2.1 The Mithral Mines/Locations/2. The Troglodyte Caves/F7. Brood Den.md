> As you enter this cave, the hideous stench somehow grows even worse. Three large troglodytes squat in the centre of the cave. From their looks, these are the brood mothers for a litter of more than a dozen young. The broodlings are currently tearing their weakest sibling limb from limb as it squeals in terror.

The broodmothers are bigger than average and have the statistics of **troglodyte brutes**. They will viciously defend their young and fight to the death. 

There are twelve troglodyte broodlings (8 AC, 1 HP). They hiss at the heroes, but they do not attack. If approached, they will try to bite the heroes. Such heroes must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 1 piercing damage and become poisoned for 1 hour.

If the broodlings are not slain, they will grow into adult troglodytes within 1 week. This may create a minor moral dilemma for the party.
