> The tunnel descends into the earth. Out of the darkness rises a stench worse than anything you have ever known. The shrieking sound from deep within the caves suddenly ceases.

The cave entrance is guarded by four troglodytes. They press up against the sides of the tunnel and have advantage on their Stealth checks due to their chameleon trait. Every six hours, the troglodyte guards here are replaced by four new troglodytes from deeper in the caves.
