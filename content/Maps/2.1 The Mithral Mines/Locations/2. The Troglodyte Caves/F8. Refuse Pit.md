> A darkened pit gapes in the centre of this chamber. The sides of the pit are coated with wretched streaks of black and brown. You choke on the stench, which burns your eyes and nostrils.

This is where the troglodytes leave their waste. Entering this room requires each hero to make a successful **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or be poisoned for 1 hour.

### Treasure

Buried 5 feet under the disgusting muck is a mithral breastplate, mithral ring mail, an adamantine short sword and an adamantine spear. None of these items radiate magic, so the only way to find them is to poke around in the refuse. Finding an item requires one minute and a successful **DC 15 Investigation check**. Anyone who touches the filth automatically fails at any stealth-based activity until they can have a bath.
