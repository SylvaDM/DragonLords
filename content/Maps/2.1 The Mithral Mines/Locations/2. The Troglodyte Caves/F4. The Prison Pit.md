> A natural stair descends into a cavern lit by the flickering fire of a roasting pit. The partially-burnt body of a centaur is spitted over the pit. Across the room is a prison pen fashioned out of petrified timber. It is currently holding a centaur that is being tormented by a half-dozen loathsome lizard people. The creatures poke at the centaur with sharpened sticks and croak with delight when he cries out in pain.

This prison pit is where the troglodytes keep any prey that they capture. There are four **troglodytes** in the room. In addition, two **troglodyte brutes** are hidden against the walls, and they have advantage on Stealth checks due to their chameleon trait. They attack immediately and fight to the death.

### Captured Centaurs
The young **centaur** being held captive here is Kaluk, one of Hukarâ€™s kin. The spitted centaur is Hirak, who can still be saved with healing spells if the heroes move quickly enough. He will die within five rounds unless healed. Both Kaluk and Hirak wish to leave the mines as quickly as possible.
