> This rocky ledge leads up from the riverbank and passes through a short tunnel, which deflects an endless cascade of water from the Great Falls. The ledge grows narrower as it ascends, stretching for a quarter-mile along a sheer cliff of slick black rock. Beyond the ledge, a shimmering curtain of translucent water spills down to crash on the rocks below. Cold white mist fogs your vision, and roaring water drowns out all other sound.

This path leads under the waterfall. Anyone walking along it is sprayed with water from the falls. Wet moss covers the sides, though the path itself is well used and

relatively safe. This is the main path used by troglodytes to go hunting at night. There is a rope ladder that leads down to the river below that troglodytes use when they go fishing. This pathway was carved into the cliffside centuries ago when the dwarves were first exploring the natural caves behind the waterfall.

## Encounter: Troglodyte Foragers
> A stink wafts up from below as four filthy-looking humanoids clamber onto the path ahead. Each carries a net full of wriggling fish. Upon seeing you, the troglodytes drop their fish and chatter to each other. The stench is nearly overwhelming. You notice a hungry gleam in their eyes.

These troglodytes are part of a daily expedition sent to fish the river further down from the falls. There are three **troglodytes** and one **troglodyte brute**. They attack the heroes as soon as they spot them.
