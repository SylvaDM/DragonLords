> This natural tunnel runs for fifty feet at a slight incline. The floor is wet and moss grows along the walls and ceiling. The floor is well-used, covered in the tracks of the foul creatures from the waterfall. The tunnel eventually forks. To the left, the tunnel continues into a network of natural caves. A terrible stench comes from this direction, along with echoing shrieks of pain and horror. To the right, the tunnel becomes a stonework passageway.

This corridor is heavily used. Every time the heroes travel through the tunnel, there is a 1 in 6 chance that they encounter a band of (2d4 + 2) **troglodytes** led by a **troglodyte brute**. One troglodyte will run back to the warrens to raise the alarm, while the other troglodytes fight to the death.
