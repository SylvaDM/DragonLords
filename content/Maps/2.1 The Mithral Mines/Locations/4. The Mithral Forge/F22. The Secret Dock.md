> This chamber leads to a secret dock, which is located behind the Great Falls. The stone dock extends behind the thundering waterfall. The room is filled with rotting sacks, barrels, and boxes. There is an ornate bronze lever on the far side of the room.

This room is a dock that is large enough for most ships. A beautifully carved bronze lever extends from the wall. It can be used to activate a stonework dam at the top of the river that creates a gap in the waterfall. Once the heroes have the Ultros, they may use this lever to dock beneath the waterfall and return to the Mithral Forge.

## Using the Mithral Forge
Refer to the Treasures appendix for information about how the heroes can make use of the Mithral Forge. 

If the heroes make a deal with the Forgekeeper and discover the docks, then they can easily return to the Forge. The Forgekeeper will work with Volkan to make items from any components that they bring. The dock is well hidden and has been forgotten by everyone, so it makes a good hiding place for any ship that the heroes might have, including the Ultros.
