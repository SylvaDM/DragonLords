> This room is lined with iron racks for holding weapons and armour. Almost all of the racks have been tipped over, and the only weapons and armour that remain are broken or corroded. Bones and refuse lay in piles in the corners of the room.

The armoury was ransacked long ago and all that remains is rotten wood, refuse, bones, and broken equipment. The armour and weapons are of exquisite make, but they have been rendered useless by centuries of neglect.

### Treasure
There is a *mithral xiphos +1* buried under the refuse. It is covered in a layer of dirty grime and corrosion. It can be located with a successful **DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check** or with the *detect magic* spell.
