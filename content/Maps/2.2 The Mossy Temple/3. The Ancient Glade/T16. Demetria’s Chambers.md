> This lushly appointed bedroom is covered in rugs along the floor and silks along the wall. A beautiful bed carved from living oak dominates the centre of the room.

Demetria spends most of her time in these chambers, enjoying the company of love-besotted teenagers. She lures them here before using them in her evil rituals.

## Treasure
Demetria keeps her valuables locked in a trunk. The lock can be opened with a successful **DC 15 Dexterity** check with thieves' tools. Inside are trinkets and other items stolen from the teenagers she has kidnapped. This haul includes two necklaces worth 100 gp each. There are also four rings worth 50 gp each and a half dozen gems of different sorts each worth 50 gp.

### Ritual Tome
The most important item is a tome bound in human skin. Inside is a description written by Lutheria herself on the ritual of transformation that turns a human woman into a maenad.
