> This tunnel leads deeper below the earth. Stone archways support a low ceiling of rocky dirt. Curtains of heavy roots and vines hang down from the archways, blocking your view of the way forward.

The roots do nothing when they are first encountered. However, if Demetria attempts to flee through the tunnel, she can use these roots to restrain the heroes.
