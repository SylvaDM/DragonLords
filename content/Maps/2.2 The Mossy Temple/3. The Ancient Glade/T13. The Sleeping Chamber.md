> This round chamber looks to be a warm and comfortable sleeping chamber with feather pillows and animal skins. Four young men and women sleep upon the skins.

There are four teenagers sleeping in this chamber. Their names are Nikon, Markos, Theophania, and Phokas. They have the stats of **commoners** and behave in the same way as the teenagers from the [[T9. Cavern of Fungus|Cavern of Fungus (T9)]], although they are not poisoned. 

### Grasping Roots
There are two **roots** close to the entrance to the cave. These roots will attempt to grapple anyone who tries to leave the room without Demetria's permission. As with other roots, they do nothing to those who are entering the chamber.
