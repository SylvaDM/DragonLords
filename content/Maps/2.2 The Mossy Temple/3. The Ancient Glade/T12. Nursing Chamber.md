> This small stone chamber has been made warm and comfortable with feathered pillows and animal skins. A bronze lantern hangs from the ceiling, bathing the room with flickering golden light. Aromatic incense smoke rises from a brass censer, although this doesn’t quite disguise the smell of goats.

There are two **maenads** present in this chamber with their goatling children. The maenads are drinking wine, eating mushrooms, and feeding their children the same. When the maenads spot the heroes, they demand to know who they are, while the goatlings will growl and hiss. If the heroes can come up with a convincing lie, a successful **DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check** will put the maenads back at ease. In this case, they invite the party to enjoy their wine and mushrooms.

### Frenzied Maenads
If the heroes don’t immediately provide a satisfactory lie, then the maenads will enter a frenzy of drunken bloodlust and attack.

### Baby Goatlings
The four young goatlings carry small knives for cutting mushrooms. The goatlings have AC 10 and 1 HP each. They threaten the heroes with their knives, but they are too timid to attack.
