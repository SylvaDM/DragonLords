> In the room behind the baths, a stairway descends into the shadows of the lower floor. The stairs are watched over by four hideous stone statues. Each appears in the form of a six-armed cyclops. The statues are missing arms, legs and heads, and two of them hold discoloured bronze bowls in their lower arms.

Two of the statues are merely inanimate and will collapse into dust when touched. The other two statues retain the magic that animated them as guardians centuries ago. The statues have the statistics of **gargoyles** with no fly speed. They awaken and attack when an intruder starts to descend the stairway. However, should someone place an offering in the bowl held by one of the statues and say a short prayer to Sydon, the statues will remain inanimate.

### Suspicious Footprints
The stairs are marked by dozens of hoofprints and human footprints, some of which track through haphazard splashes of red wine.
