> This chamber is dominated by a beautiful marble statue of the Titan, Sydon. The Lord of Storms sits upon his throne, hunching slightly so that his massive form seems too large for the room. The ceiling is domed, with an oculus that allows through a broad ray of light. Sydon holds a large mirror, which catches the light and directs it through a small shaft that opens below his feet.
 
This central chamber is quiet. There are no animal sounds and the statue seems to stare at the heroes. If Herkus is present in squirrel form, he shrieks and throws a nut at the statue’s head.

### Small Shaft
The mirror reflects light into a small hole in the floor. A Small-sized creature can crawl down the shaft, which leads to another mirror and then goes straight down into the [[T8. The Ancient Glade|Ancient Glade (T8)]]. Someone can drop down 20 feet into the chamber. They must succeed on a **DC 10 Dexterity saving throw** or they take **7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage**.

### The Statue and Mirror
The statue is made of marble around a core of adamantine with an AC of 18, 100 HP, and a damage threshold of 5. The mirror is polished adamantine with an AC of 23, 30 HP, and a damage threshold of 5. Attacking either object will make a loud echoing noise. Attacking twice will alert the entire complex to the heroes’ presence.
