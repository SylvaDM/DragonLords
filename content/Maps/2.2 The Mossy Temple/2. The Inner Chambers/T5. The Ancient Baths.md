> This expansive, rectangular room is shrouded in darkness. You hear the echoing sounds of droplets falling into a vast pool of deep, stagnant water. Black vines and massive tree roots climb down the walls and wind across the room. As you walk forward, the stone floor gradually descends into the water.

This room is part of an ancient bath complex. There are public baths in the city of Mytros, but this one is far older. The fountains would normally be running at all times, refreshing the water in the pool, but these probably havenâ€™t worked for centuries.

### Stagnant Oozes
The pool water is the domain of two **grey oozes**. These grey oozes remain motionless and invisible at the bottom of the pool. They will only attack someone who enters the water.

### Animated Roots
Demetria has ordered the **roots** here to attack anyone except goatlings, satyrs, and maenads. Two roots will attempt to grab and restrain the heroes. The roots will drag and hold anyone they grapple under the water: refer to the rules on holding your breath and drowning. Because the roots are beneath murky water, attacks against them have disadvantage. Any creature dragged underwater will also be attacked by the gray oozes.
