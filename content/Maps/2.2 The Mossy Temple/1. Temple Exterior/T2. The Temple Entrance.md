> The clearing grows wider as you continue eastward. Ruined architecture seems to suddenly loom over you. You realize that what you thought were trees are actually towering pillars of fluted marble, overgrown with vines and green moss. The columns stand in two rows, marching toward a massive stone temple facade. The ruins are worn with unfathomable age, and several of the pillars toppled and shattered centuries ago.

>Dozens of gargantuan tree roots wind their way through the clearing, climbing over fallen pillars and rupturing the walls of the temple.

There are a few ways into the inner chambers of the temple. No one guards the temple, but the roots of the ancient oaks can be animated by Demetria. She can use a bonus action to cause one of the roots to attack any creature within reach. The roots can discern race, so Demetria can allow certain races, such as satyrs and goatlings, to come and go as they please.

### Animated Roots
Each root has an AC of 10 and 10 HP. Each root can make one attack per round: +3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 10) and restrained until the grapple ends. The roots have a passive Perception of 14.
