> A broad, circular, white marble building stands apart from the other structures in this district. It's divided into three floors with rows of symmetrical windows. Several large bronze tablets at the entrance of the building describe the laws of the city.

The court building is circular and its interior has ten rows of seats that circle the entire inside circumference. At the center is a raised platform where both accused and the accuser stand. Court cases in Mytros are decided by jury, and the court can accommodate more than 300 jury members at once, if required.
