>This gate is decorated with beautiful statuary and surrounded by lush greenery. The stairway beneath the gate leads up to a verdant plateau: the Noble District.

This is a sister to the Royal Gate. The road here is twice as wide as the way to the Royal Gate, because it has to accommodate mercantile traffic coming and going to the Harbor. The gate is guarded by two **captains** who keep an eye out for riff-raff from *Stygian Row*.
