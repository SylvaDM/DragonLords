> This heavily-trafficked gate leads northward into the Heartlands. During the day, the road is filled with centurions, pilgrims, and merchants traveling between Mytros and Estoria. At night, the road is patrolled by soldiers with torches, who rotate shifts between a series of stone guard towers.

This gate is always guarded by two **captains** and twelve **soldiers**. They are replaced each hour by an identical squad from one of the towers along the road.
