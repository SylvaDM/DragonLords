> This bustling dockyard boasts dozens of galleys, each of which bristles with banks of oars. Many of the ships seem to have sustained serious damage recently. You can hear a chorus of hammering from the drydocks.

The dockyard is always bustling during the day. Although many merchants trade and bank in the Royal District, many come dockside to work and barter. There are bargains to be had with the many ships that arrive here from across Thylea. There are also more than a dozen drydocks where ships are repaired.

## Sacrificial Stockyard
There is a stockyard here that sells sacrificial animals for the ceremonies that are customarily performed before ships embark on ocean voyages. The heroes may purchase such animals and sacrifice them to gain favour with the gods, or to avoid confrontations at sea.
