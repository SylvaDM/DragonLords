> The black, rocky crags of Mount Volkan loom over the northern quarter of the city. At its summit, the great mountain dips into a gently-sloping basin. Although trees grow in abundance on the mountainâ€™s slopes, the interior basin has been cleared to create flat fields.

*The Great Games* are held at the peak of Mount Volkan. The proving grounds for the Games are inside the basin like crater of the extinct volcano. The Great Games are held outside of the city walls, because they are held sacred as a neutral, non-political event. All of the Kings of Thylea send their best to compete in the Games.
