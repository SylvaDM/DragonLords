> A fine theater stands at the foot of the Temple Hill. Rows of seats built into the hillside are arranged around a polished marble stage. Behind the stage is a small building where stagehands and costumed actors come and go, carrying elaborate props.

The theater has a marble stage that extends in front of an orchestra pit. It has a four-tiered seating area that ascends the slope of the hill. The building behind the stage has rooms for actors to prepare and storage for props and movable scenery. 

The Wine Festival. The theatre usually stands empty, but if the Wine Festival is happening in Mytros, then it will be busy for a full week. Refer to the Wine Festival event in the [[E1. Public Amphitheatre|City of Estoria (E1)]] for details.
