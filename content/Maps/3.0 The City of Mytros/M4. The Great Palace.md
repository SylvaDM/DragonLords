> The Great Palace stands at the top of an impressive stone stairway. It is similar in appearance to the temples of the gods, except that its design emphasizes its civic function. Rather than statues to the gods, the palace is decorated with royal seals and with bronze tablets describing the legal codes of the city.

While not nearly as grand as the city's temples, this palace is still an impressive building. The stairs lead to an expansive antechamber, which connects to the throne room in the Royal Hall. This is where **King Acastus** can be found during the day.

The heroes are summoned here when they first arrive in the city. King Acastus is usually accompanied by his advisor, [[Chondrus]] (see appendix), his concubine **Bella** (CN [[noble]]), and [[Commander Gaius|Gaius]], commander of the Order of Sydon (see appendix). Acastus is always protected by five of his best centurions (LG *captains*).

##### Permission to Enter the Palace
The city guards generally restrict access to the Great Palace, but the heroes are allowed entry because they have been summoned by the king. After their audience with Queen Vallus, the heroes can revisit the palace whenever they like. Refer to the Summoned by the King section for details.
