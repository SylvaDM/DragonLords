> This bronze colossus is recognizable as a young version of Pythor, God of Battle and current King of Estoria. The statueâ€™s head is wreathed by a crown of leaves. Despite its relaxed stance and serene gaze, the statue seems alert to anything that might threaten the city.

This colossus is one of the wonders of Thylea. The twin colossi were constructed before the First War with the aid of Volkan, God of the Forge. In times of need, the statues could be activated to defend Mytros. Refer to the Colossus of Pythor section for details.
