> This bathhouse boasts two large baths, both the size of swimming pools. One is filled with hot water, while the other is filled with bracingly cold water. The connected buildings include two huge open air gymnasiums and dozens of smaller rooms for massages.

There are several bathhouses located in the city of Mytros, but all of them pale in significance when compared to this one. Queen Vallus had this bathhouse constructed two centuries ago, to celebrate victory in one of the Aresian campaigns. It is a place for exercise, business agreements, courtships, gossipâ€”and even the occasional bath. While visiting the bathhouse is ostensibly free, there are several acolytes collecting donations.
