> This crowded marketplace smells strongly of brine. Barrels of freshly-caught fish line every stall, many of which have just been unloaded from nearby ships.

The fish market is especially crowded in the afternoon, when the fishing boats start returning from the Cerulean Gulf. Fish of every sort can be found on sale here, including unusual catches like sharks, eels, and octopuses. Quality fishing supplies can also be purchased here, including bait, tackle, and nets.

### The Ancient Mariner
One of the merchants here is a dwarf who has sailed Thylea's oceans for over 500 years. His name is **Samuel** (TN **veteran**), and although he's lost dozens of comrades to the treachery of the seas, he still makes sacrifices to the Lord of Storms. Samuel has lots of useful sailing advice to offer to heroes who are willing to listen to him. One of his favorite stories to tell is about a legendary city on the back of a dragonturtle that wanders the Forgotten Sea.
