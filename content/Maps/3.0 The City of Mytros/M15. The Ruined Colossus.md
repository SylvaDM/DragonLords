> Although this bronze colossus lies in ruins, it seems that it once depicted the city’s patron goddess, Mytros. A large pyre blazes at the statue’s feet, and a small crowd has gathered around it.

This colossus was destroyed two centuries ago, and the tale is still told with horror by the people of Mytros. The Kraken, a terrifying creature from the Forgotten Sea, attacked the city during a powerful storm. The twin colossi wrestled the creature back into the ocean, but the Colossus of Mytros was torn apart in the struggle. She returned to her guard post and collapsed into ruin.
