> The once-great Estorian Palace looms high over the city. Large windows let in copious amounts of sunlight, which fails to chase away the gloom that has settled in the palace. As you walk the halls, you notice evidence of the court’s past glory in the form of precious artifacts dating back to the First War. Extravagant tapestries show tales of Estoria’s history and King Pythor’s grand adventures, though more recent events are nowhere to be seen on the hangings.

The Estorian palace is simple in design. It boasts a single great hall flanked by side chambers for the kitchens, servant’s quarters, and bedrooms. At the back is a stairway that descends to the basements where storage chambers and dungeons are located. [[Pythor | King Pythor]] (see appendix) can always be found in the great hall, accompanied by a half-dozen of his advisors (LN [[noble | nobles]]).

The first time the heroes come to the palace, refer to the adventure section, *The King's Daughter*.
