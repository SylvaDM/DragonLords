> Three distinct groups of buildings are walled off from the rest of the city. The simple stone houses in the first complex line the central courtyard in neat rows. The structures of the second group are covered with ornate statuettes and carvings. The third group is a rustic collection of humble brick homes.

This is the residential district of the city. The citizens of Estoria are divided into three neighbourhoods. The soldiers live in the first area, the craftsmen in the second, and the farmers in the third. These homes are walled off from the outside, but each includes a spacious interior courtyard which provides an open view of the sky.
