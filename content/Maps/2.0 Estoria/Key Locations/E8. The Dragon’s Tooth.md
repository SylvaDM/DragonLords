> A nondescript brick building with carved white stone accents, the popular public house distinguishes itself by the sheer amount of activity in and around it. Patrons regularly drift in and out in varying states of sobriety. The scent of food and sounds of raucous conversation emanate from the open door and windows.

This public house is frequented by merchants and soldiers staying at the thatched inns in the southern outskirts of town. Lodging at an inn can be arranged with the bartender, a wiry old white-haired man named **Delphion** (NG [[veteran]]). He is friendly and knowledgeable, but has little patience for small-talk or superstition. He knows of the party’s quest, and will help them however he can.

## Rumours in The Dragon’s Tooth
> Stepping through the door, you see that the busy street outside the tavern barely hinted at the sheer number of patrons crammed inside. Locals and travellers from across Thylea crowd around the bar and an assortment of wooden tables, sharing the latest gossip.

The patrons of The Dragon’s Tooth are talkative. The heroes can learn many rumors by speaking to the merchants, soldiers, and farmers who gather there:

## Quest: The Dwarves of Estoria

There are several dwarves who visit The Dragon’s Tooth every night. They work the local copper mine.

The dwarves are part of a clan that was forced to flee the Mithral Mines centuries ago. Some of them are old enough to have been alive when that event took place. They have no interest in returning to the Mithral Mines, even if it were to be cleared out, because they know that the entire place was cursed by the Titan, Lutheria.

However, some of the oldest members of the clan are still seeking closure. They would like to bury the kin that they lost in the Mithral Mines, and they are willing to pay 10 gp for each dwarven skull returned to them.
