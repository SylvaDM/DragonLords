>Grassland stretches across the horizon as far as you can see. The sun shines down from a perfect, cloudless blue sky. A refreshing breeze blows across your skin and through the waves of green grass. The picturesque serenity of this vast, rolling landscape is at odds with the dangers that lurk in this untamed wilderness.

The lands north of Estoria and across the Arkelon River are too dangerous for travel. Bands of **centaurs** patrol the grasslands just a few miles away from Estoria. Occasionally a **cyclops** will lumber through the grasslands as well. If the heroes are determined to explore the lands north of the Arkelon they will be discouraged by a **cyclops** that throws boulders at them from 200 ft. away. He will (deliberately) miss several times, but if the heroes don’t get the message, he will begin to aim directly at them. If they attack him, a band of a dozen **centaurs** will come to the cyclops’s aid.
