> This lonely vineyard is on the outskirts of the city. Wooden trellises erupt from the tilled soil in neat, symmetrical rows. Healthy green vines wind around these structures, bearing a bountiful crop of brilliant purple grapes. After some walking, you find a fit middle-aged man among the vines, pruning the plants with great care. Upon hearing your approach, the man turns to greet you. Although he appears friendly, his brow is deeply furrowed with apprehension.

**Thericles** (NG *scout*) used to serve the King but has now retired to the outskirts of Estoria to tend to his vineyard with his husband. He is descended from the Phobas family line of the Dragonlords, and he is highly respected by the citizens of Estoria. He is currently in despair because his daughter Corinna has gone missing.

## Quest: Missing Daughter

Thericles wants someone to find out what has happened to his daughter. She disappeared into the Oldwood a week ago, and Thericles has been unable to track her.

In actuality, Corinna is one of many teenagers who have been lured into the Mossy Temple by a tribe of goatlings who serve the corrupted dryad, Demetria.

### Reward
If the heroes are able to rescue Corinna and bring her back, Thericles is overjoyed. While he is not a wealthy man, he does have a family heirloom: a *javelin of lightning*. He gladly gives it to the heroes as a reward
