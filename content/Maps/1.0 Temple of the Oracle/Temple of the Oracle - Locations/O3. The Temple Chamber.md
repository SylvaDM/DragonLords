> The inner chamber of the temple is dominated by a massive bronze statue of Sydon, who sits upon a throne at the rear of the cella. At the foot of the statue is a rectangular pool, which reflects the light of four large braziers into rippling patterns on the ceiling.

Five men clad in bronze mail and bright blue cloaks are gathered around the sacrificial bier. They appear to have taken the temple attendants hostage. One of the hostages is shouting at the soldiers.

Braeca (LE [[acolyte|Acolyte]]) is waiting inside the temple with another four soldiers. He is holding Proteus (LG acolyte) and three temple attendants (LG commoners) captive, but he does not intend to harm them. However, the dead bodies of several more temple attendants are strewn about the temple in a bloody mess.

Proteus is the elder attendant of this temple, and he is loudly and forcefully pleading with Braeca to stop “the witch” from harming Versi. If questioned, he explains that a sea hag named Heleka arrived at the temple two weeks ago. She has been wantonly slaughtering his acolytes in order to torment the captive Oracle.

*Sacrificial Bier.* There is a bronze bier in the room where sacrificial offerings are usually made by the priests. Animal bones are scattered among the ashes.

*Treasure.* Braeca and his men are carrying 25 gp and 100 sp. Braeca carries a bronze symbol of Sydon, which depicts the wrathful visage of the Lord of Storms.
