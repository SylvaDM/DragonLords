> The Temple of the Oracle is located in a cleft in the earth, many leagues from the nearest settlement. As you descend into the chasm, the forest disappears, replaced by steep walls of craggy rock. Warm vapours rise from cracks and vents along the floor of the chasm, filling the air with an eerie mist. You feel yourselves sweating from the heat and exertion.

While crossing through the chasm, the heroes may accidentally stumble across geysers of boiling steam that suddenly shoot up. Each time the heroes move in the rocky area of this chasm, they must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are blasted by scalding steam and take 2d6 fire damage.

### Minions of Heleka
There are four [[steam-mephit|Steam Mephit]]s in the chasm. They were summoned by Heleka and ordered to prevent anyone from getting close to the Temple. The mephits will attempt to lure heroes to cross the boiling geysers.
