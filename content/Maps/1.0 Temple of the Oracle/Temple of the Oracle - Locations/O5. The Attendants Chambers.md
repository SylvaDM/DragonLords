These seven rooms are where the temple attendants sleep. All of the rooms are sparse and tidy. Heleka enchanted four [[flying-sword|Flying Swords]] and left them hanging on the wall next to the key to the locked stairway door ([[O4. Locked Stairway Door|O4]]). The swords remain motionless until the key is touched, at which point they come alive and attack.

***Treasure.*** The priests keep no material wealth. They have extra robes, boots, and scrolls inscribed with prayers to the gods. Proteusâ€™s room is the one exception. He has a small chest that contains six potions of healing.
