> Liquid blue light shimmers and refracts across the slick walls of this rocky grotto. The room is lit by torches and filled with the vaporous mist of steaming hot springs. You can hear water cascading into an underground river at the rear of the cave.

[[Versi the Oracle|Versi]] has lived in the waters of this cave for centuries, attended by the faithful acolytes who serve her Temple. She spends her days on the rock in the center of the cave, inhaling the vapors of the hot spring and listening to her dreams for new prophecies. Her visions have always come true, and she is therefore greatly feared and admired by the people of Thylea. This cave and the resting chamber beyond it should be considered her lair.

One of the rugs in the centre of this grotto is actually a [[rug-of-smothering|Rug of Smothering]]. It will attack anyone who tries to move deeper into the cave. Heleka is in the Oracleâ€™s resting chamber, where she is torturing one of the temple attendants in order to torment the Oracle herself.
