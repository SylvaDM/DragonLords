> This massive temple has been built directly into the wall of the canyon. Towering columns support a pediment that is carved from the rocky cliff-face. A marble frieze of Sydon sits enthroned above the centre columns, his black glaive in one hand.

Standing at the centre of the portico are four men clad in bronze mail and bright blue cloaks.

Braeca has posted four soldiers here. The soldiers have been told to expect a band of dangerous warriors and, consequently, their nerves are somewhat on edge. They will not immediately abandon their post, but they are easy to intimidate. They will eventually flee into the temple unless the heroes corner them or otherwise goad them into a fight.
