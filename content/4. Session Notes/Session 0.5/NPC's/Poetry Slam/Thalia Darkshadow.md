**Name:** Thalia Darkshadow
**Race:** Tiefling
**Age:** 20

**Physical Description:** Thalia is a Tiefling with midnight black skin and deep crimson eyes that seem to glow in the shadows, her long horns curling back from her temples. She wears tattered black clothing that blends seamlessly with the darkness, her silhouette a haunting presence against the backdrop of a desolate wasteland, cinematic lighting, photorealistic, portrait, D&D, 5e.

**Personality:** Thalia is brooding and pessimistic, haunted by past traumas and harbouring a deep distrust of the world around her.

**Speech:** Thalia's voice is low and husky, tinged with bitterness and sorrow. "Life's a cruel joke, ain't it? You think you've found something worth holding onto, only to watch it slip away in the end. Trust me, I've been there. It's all just a matter of time before the darkness consumes us all."
