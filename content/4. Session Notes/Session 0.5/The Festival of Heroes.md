## The Oracle of Delve Deep

>Thorne's tent is a striking sight amidst the lively festival atmosphere. Its exterior is adorned with deep hues of blue and gold, reminiscent of the night sky sprinkled with stars. At the entrance, a wooden sign proclaims "The Oracle of Delve Deep" in bold letters, catching the eye of passersby and drawing them in with an air of mystery.
>
>Inside, the tent is dimly lit by soft, flickering lanterns suspended from the ceiling. Shadows dance along the walls, adding to the ambiance of the space. The interior is adorned with tapestries depicting scenes of cosmic wonder, depicting constellations, swirling galaxies, and other celestial phenomena.
>
>A low table sits at the centre of the tent, covered with a rich velvet cloth embroidered with intricate patterns. On the table are various divination tools: crystal balls, rune stones, and decks of tarot cards. Comfortable cushions are scattered around the table, offering seating for visitors seeking guidance from the enigmatic oracle.
>
>Despite its seemingly humble appearance, there is an undeniable sense of magic and mystery that permeates the tent. 

The Characters will be invited to come in together by a by [[Thorne Ironheart]]. He will offer to give them readings of ignoring any requests of Alexios to go first. 

The following are obviously fake readings:

	"Beware the dancing shadows under the moon's light, for they hide a great treasure that will bring both fortune and peril."

    "A journey across the sea awaits you, where a fearsome beast lies in wait. Only with courage and cunning will you emerge victorious."

    "The ancient ruins hold the key to unlocking your destiny. Seek out the lost artifact hidden within, and you shall wield power beyond imagination."

    "A mysterious stranger will cross your path, bearing a gift of great importance. Trust in their guidance, for they hold the key to your future."

    "A riddle of the stars will lead you to a hidden sanctuary, where the spirits of the ancients dwell. Heed their wisdom, for it will guide you on your path."

When it comes time for Alexios the Dwarf looks cautious briefly before his eyes roll back in his head and he speaks with three feminine voices at once:

> Revealed are the pieces but the board is yet to be readied. Look around little bird and remember them well for you'll need them when the time to play has come. Many threads hang near the shears. Your fate we seek to ensure. Be as cunning as the wily fox, swift as the darting hare. Flee, little ones, flee with all your might, for the shadows hunger and the night grows long. Fight only if you must, and even then, let caution guide your hand. For in the face of overwhelming dread, survival is the greatest victory.  t'would be a shame to lose the game before it's even begun. 
> 
> Now you little bird. You who rides the tapestry with such purpose,  such grace, so acutely aware of our hands. We offer thee a boon, an oath, a promise. The power to defend, attack, assert you will, and ours. In return for our aid, we only ask for boon in return, your compliance, nay your obedience. 
> 
> Consider though this last warning we offer you for free. For the only way you all make it out, is with the power of we three.

Time stands still in this moment. Alexios must respond. 

When Alexios gives his reply, the Dwarf cackles with the eery female voices as screams start to echo out from outside. 

> The dwarf, still in his trance, though this time it is his own voice that speaks. "The river's heart will lead you to safety" He falls unconcscious. 

If roused he grabs as many valuables and tries to escape.

## Party Crashers

As the players leave the tent:
> Smoke. It assaults your eyes and nose the moment you step out of the oracle's tent. The civilians are in disarray, people running and screaming. It's unclear what has happened but in the distance you hear the clash of weapons. Harpies, over head swooping down nearby picking off easy smaller targets. You hear guttural roars in the distance being made by something large. Wagons and stalls have bene tipped over and it's only now that you notice the sun is sinking down below the horizon. 

What do you do?

The following complications will present as the party tries to flee.

### Fallen Harpy
As the party flee towards their escape they hear a screech overhead. 

>You hear a screech overhead. The unmistakable warbling of a harpy descending on it's prey... You. As you you all look up you see a harpy diving towards you all. Suddenly a javelin impales one of the harpies wings and her torso. In the direction the javelin came from you see Arion Stormheart yelling for you to run. He is then knocked back by charging Cyclops out of your line of sight. 
>
>You hear the gurgling of the Harpy's voice as she tries to put you under the effects of her song. Arion's spear has caused her lungs and throat to fill with blood, preventing her from singing. The creature looks at you with wild eyes, filled with rage, her head twisting at seemingly impossible angles. Heavily wounded though she may be this Harpy is intent on taking you with her.

The Harpy is heavily wounded and only has 18 hit points.
she has 20ft movement or can use an action to extend her movement to 30ft. as she hops with one wing.
She can not fly as her wing is damaged beyond use. 
She has disadvantage on her attack rolls and saving throws due to her injuries.
She can not land critical hits, even with a natural 20.
She has the following actions:

| Action | Bonus | Damage | Damage Type |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Claws | +1 | 1d4+1 | slashing |

Once the characters dispatch the Harpy they can move on. 

### You mightn't like them but no one deserves that...

This scenario poses a moral choice.

> As you round a corner you see a group of armed men loom over some familiar children. They are surrounded, backs by a burning tent and surrounded by these armed an dangerous looking men and women. One of the children makes eye contact with you and mouths a wordless "help". 

The players can't hope to take on these soldiers but they could create a distraction. 
If it does end in a fight, Aria arrives and sings what sounds like a lullaby, putting the soldiers to sleep and ushering the children away as a centaur comes galloping down the road. She draws an elegant rapier and if the children look back they her expertly perform a number of skilled fencing moves, piercing the centaurs heart, while also sustaining a fatal injury herself. 

Whether they see her fall or even about the screams and fires and clashing steel the party can here the lament of the nearby old wood. The birds all sing out as one, Robins, sparrows, owls, nightingales and gulls alike. Whatever Aria was, she is no more. 

### Home Stretch

> Chests heaving, hearts pounding so hard you can hear the blood rushing in your ears. Adrenaline is the only thing keeping you going. Through the most dangerous of the attach you've made it near the edge of the old wood. Plaedon, the path you know well that is concealed behind the tree line and follows the river is just ahead. 
> A slender figure steps out of the shadowy tree line "Not so fast, it's dangerous for children to be out her on their own"

The figure is a gorgon. Their voice is serpentine and the hood of their cloak seems to undulate unnaturally. You think you hear a subtle hiss coming from the creature. She moves with delicate grace reminiscent of a snake about to strike.

She is intrigued by the characters and is willing to talk to them. She keeps her hood pulled over her eyes unless they attack. 

This occurs beside the river.

The party can try to persuade her to let them go. 

she comments about the reek of the fates upon them. 

She notices that one is clearly from a class above the others and directly addresses Mona

> "And why does one such as you mingle with likes of urchins, beasts, and wildlings? Does it give you a thrill to play amongst the poor and down trodden? No? Ahhh. We always want what we can't have don't we" She smiles at Mona. 

She taunts Mona trying to undestand why she is here. If Mona indicates she is looking for a way to escape her name, the gorgon curses her, if they spite the gorgon or trick her, she will curse Mona out of spite. She wont fight the children directly, but will make as if she will. If a fight is about to break out. The Nymphs feel something at teh edge of their perception. Through Plaedon's connection to the river and Faidon druidic magic they can sweep teh gorgon away in a brief rush of water from the river. 

## Home sweet home
They can make it back to Plaedon's home. His dad's are there and offer shelter to the children until tomorrow at the very least. 
The players must decide what they do next and the Dad's will make comment about a mark that has appeared on their son. This is on all the children. Marked by the Fates.
