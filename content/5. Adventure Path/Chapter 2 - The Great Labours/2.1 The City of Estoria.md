![[City of Estoria]]
# Overview
Estoria is the largest settlement along the Arkelon River. It is built into a rocky gorge, sprawling down from a stone-walled fortress that faces the steppes to the north. The Arkelon itself runs along the northern edge of the fortress, and forms a natural moat that can only be crossed by a bridge at the north gate or at the ford near the Rock of Estor. On the far side of the river from the city are grasslands where bands of centaurs patrol.

## Approaching Estoria
Most travelers approach Estoria from the southern gate, which is lightly guarded so that merchant caravans can easily ferry their goods in and out of the city. The north gate, on the other hand, is heavily guarded by suspicious soldiers who will only admit the heroes once they recognize them as the Oracle’s ‘Chosen Ones.'

>This settlement is nestled between the cliffs of a rocky gorge. The north wall of the town is part of a stone fortress, and protects the town from any dangers that might come from the steppes. Houses, taverns, and shops of all kinds sprawl down from the fortress, filling much of the gorge. The northern wall is defended by a legion of soldiers, while the southern gates admit a steady stream of travellers and merchant caravans. The road that runs south from the gate is lined with tile-roofed inns.

## The Looming War

Estoria has stood for centuries as the greatest defense against the centaurs, cyclopes, manticores and other dangers to be found on the steppes north of the Arkelon River. The fortress city has been in steady decline since its god-king, Pythor, began to drown his sorrows in wine. Now, conflict threatens to swallow Estoria, and panic is setting in among its citizens.
- The surrounding farms have few livestock remaining, exhausted by the daily sacrifices demanded by Sydon.
- The city is experiencing a drought, because the Lord of Storms is withholding rain from this region.
- Cyclopes have been crossing the river and pillaging farms along the road to Mytros.
- Centaurs are gathering in record numbers, and are obviously preparing to assault the city.
- Sydon has demanded that the king's daughter be sacrificed on the night of the next full moon.
- King Pythor has gone mad with grief for his daughter.

# Arrival in Estoria
When the heroes first arrive in Estoria, run the following encounters:

## Encounter: The Southern Gates

>Approaching the city from the south, you encounter a caravan of merchants who are also headed towards Estoria. With them are the first domesticated animals you have seen in some time, a herd of bony oxen lumbering along the dusty road. The merchants seem tired, and they greet you warily.

The oxen are to be delivered to the temple, where they will be added to the other daily sacrifices made to Sydon. There are barely any draft animals left in the countryside, and even these sickly animals will fetch a high price because of the king’s desperation to appease the Titan. The merchants (LN [[commoner | commoners]]) share this sad tale with the heroes. They also describe the marauding cyclopes and centaurs that make the roads dangerous to travel.

## Quest: Summoned by the King

When the king learns that the Oracle’s ‘Chosen Ones’ have entered Estoria, he immediately sends six soldiers to fetch the heroes and escort them to his palace.

>The streets grow more crowded as you enter the city proper. Travelers and citizens mingle, exchanging both goods and gossip. Guards line the streets, though they are most concentrated by the city gates. Despite their attempts to present a stoic facade, you sense that they are restless about something.
>
>A small detachment of hoplites moves towards you from the north. One man bearing an officer’s insignia steps forward from his fellows and respectfully hails your party.

The guards treat the heroes with cautious reverence, but they cannot refuse the king’s orders. They encourage the heroes to comply, as they are afraid to return to the king empty-handed. They seem nervous about the troubles brewing in Estoria, as it is widely believed that King Pythor has gone mad.
