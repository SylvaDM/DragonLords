# Opening

The titan's have corrupted a boar and unleashed it on the heartlands east of Estoria. They are creaating fear now that the oath of peace weakens. 

Kyrah has summoned th e party to hunt the boar, and once it has been slain it should be burned as a sacrifice to one of the gods or titans. 

>The future of Thylea looks grim. Monsters menace the roads, and corruption threatens the cities. The storm god Sydon demands daily sacrifices at every temple, and his sister-wife Lutheria kidnaps children for her secret rituals. The Five Gods, who once protected the settlers, are silent. And now, the Oracle has prophesied the Doom of Thylea: the death of gods, the destruction of Mytros, and the total annihilation of the mortal races.
>
You have been summoned to the Heartlands in an attempt to avert this coming catastrophe. You were told to expect old friends and despite that each likely your own have reasons for answering the call. Nevertheless, rumours of your coming have already spread across the land.

# The Sour Vintage

>The Sour Vintage is a traditional country inn located at a crossroads, about twenty miles east of the City of Estoria. The exterior is rustic wood painted black, and the sign hanging from the door depicts a woman carrying a basket full of grapes. Inside the tavern, a haze of  pleasant tobacco smoke lingers in the air. You hear the clinking of mugs and the muttering of patrons, most of whom are farmers.
>
You have been summoned here by a woman named Kyrah who wants to hire you for a ‘difficult task’. She has promised a sizable reward, and more information about the Oracle’s prophecy.

## The Poet from Mytros

Kyrah has been sent by Versi the Oracle to gather the heroes from her vision and ensure they live up to their potential. She has assumed the identity as a Bard of some skill and renown. She knows the rumours circulating of the heroes and watches from the crowd as the heroes come and greet their childhood friends before she approaches. 

A band is set up on a small stage. The band is a quartet, two satyrs, one playing lute, another playing flute, a dwarf playing drums and the vocalist is a stunning Siren.

As the players settle in, read the following:
> A melodic voices cut through the noise, soft but commanding "Hi sour Vintage, We are Hag's Paramour. We've travelled a long way to be here with you all tonight. Sour Vintage let me hear some noise!"
> The crowd gives a response, nothing to lively but they're engaged nonetheless.
> "this is new one we wrote on the way over here. we hope you like it."

Perception/Insight to get the sense she's speaking to someone specific but unsure who.

When the Song ends the crowd cheers and the Band play some softer music. At this point player with the highest perception notices a woman with dark making eye contact and waving them over 

> A dark-haired woman calls you all over to a table in the corner. She wears a white traveling dress with practical leather boots, and she carries a large satchel that appears to contain dozens of scrolls, along with plentiful writing supplies.
> 
“Greetings, I am Kyrah. Thank you for answering my summons. I will be direct. I am here as an agent of the Oracle. She believes that great destinies await you all, but great destinies are forged by great deeds.
>
“A terrifying giant boar has been laying waste to the Heartlands, slaughtering everything in its path. This boar was corrupted by the Titans and sent to punish the mortals of Thylea for their continued faith in the Five Gods. Many have attempted to hunt the boar. All have failed.
>
“If you wish to win fame and fortune, as great heroes should, then you must prove to the people of Thylea that you are the warriors of the Oracle’s prophecy. Hunt this boar and offer it to the gods as a sacrifice."

Kyrah explains that the titans Lutheria and Sydon have always hated the mortals of Thylea. Their hate has been shackled for the last 500, however the power is now waning and this is one of many signs to come that they are plotting war upon Mytros again.

Kyrah offers assistance. She has hired two hunters who can help track down the board, they will be waiting outside the tavern an hours before dawn. She offers a reward for slaying the beast, a golden arrow worth 25gp each, 

### The Innkeeper
A retired hunter named Aetela. She knows the heartlands better than most. She encourages the party to hunt the board and recognises at least one of the characters. 

### Injured hunting party
These hunters are recovering from minor injuries. They tried to lure the boar into a trap by laying 20 pounds of rotten fruit ion the middle of a field and hiding in the nearby hedges. The boar took them by surprise and gored one of their friends and dragged him into the woods. The tried to follow but the sounds were so horrifying they knew it was hopeless. They returned to the tavern to drink to their friend memory. 

### Forlorn Farmers
Most of the patrons are farmers too afraid to tend their fields. Families are holed up in basements or fled to Estoria until the beast is dealt with. If the farmers recognise anyone they might be angry, asking why they aren't out hunting the boar right now. What else are heroes good for?

# Hunting the Boar
Kyrah and the hunters will meet the players outside the Tavern before dawn. The Hunters are Taneias and Javon (scouts). It's a cold and foggy morning and the ground wet with dew. The hunters lead them deep into the hills north of the tavern. They pass many farms and settlements that have been destroyed by the boar

> As you make your way northward into the Heartlands, you pass many ravaged farms and settlements, all attacked by the boar. The rocks and trees along the road have been gouged by its tusks, leaving deep, ragged trenches. Carrion crows flock in the fields, picking at the bodies of failed hunters and unfortunate settlers.

**DC 10 Survival** check to track the boar. If they fail they spend an entire day searching fruitlessly. Can roll on the [[Table of Random Land Encounters]] for plains whether they succeed or fail.

### Kyrah's Assistance
She will not fight but will encourage the party taking notes to write her epic poem. She will help keep their spirits up and if things look grave she might sing one of her songs.

# The Boar's Cave

The party will; eventually stumble on the boars cave. It is is inside devouring some randos.

> From this height, you can see miles of mountainous hills to the west. A thick blanket of fog hangs over the lower land, and you can hear a gentle chorus of birds greeting the morning sun. Eventually, you pick up the boar’s trail: another path of wanton destruction, split tree trunks, and splatters of blood. The trail ends at the shadowy mouth of a cave. Ear-splitting grunts and squeals echo from inside.

### Traps?
The party may want to set some traps. Each trap requires a survival check. A failure causes the boar to hear them and be alerted to their presence.

*Rope Snare.* This trap requires 50 ft. of rope. It will entangle the boar’s legs, cutting its movement speed in half and preventing it from using any charge abilities. Setting it requires a Survival DC 12 skill check.

*Spiked Pitfall.* This trap requires someone to dig a hole 10 ft. deep and fill it with sharpened wooden stakes. If the boar fails to leap over it, it will take 3d6 piercing damage and become immobilized. Digging the pitfall requires Survival DC 20 skill check.

*Spiked Barricade.* This trap requires setting up a row of sharpened stakes, angled toward the cave mouth. If the boar runs into the barricade, it will take 2d6 piercing damage. Constructing the barrier requires a Survival DC 12 skill check.

## Boar Attack!
The Boar attacks, anyone who ails a DC 16 perception check is surprised. the hunters a re killed as the boar charges out of the cave.

> Suddenly, you hear a bestial grunt from inside the cave. A massive boar suddenly charges from the cave mouth, goring both of the hunters on its tusks! Tossing the bodies away like ragdolls, the creature draws itself up to its full height. It’s an ancient white boar with fierce red eyes and bloodied yellow tusks.

The creature has spears and arrows in it, gaining a level of exhaustion at the end of each of it's turns. Sensing it is surrounded it tried to attack everyone at least once.

The Board fights until it reaches 0 hit points, at this point it can be netted and tied up. Heaving rattling breaths the creature's eyes lock with the heroes and they hear it's voice booming in their heads:
>“Know this, mortals. Your sins cannot be atoned. An ancient power sleeps in the heart of Thylea, and when it awakens, the age of Mytros will come to an end. Just as my broken body falls to ruin and decay, so too all mortal things will come to death and darkness. No prophecy will save you.”

The boar's cave is only 50ft deep. If the players go in there is some treasure.
### Treasure
The two shredded corpses inside the cave may be searched. Between them, they have 25 gp and 37 sp. One of them carried a silvered spear. Kyrah points out that it is customary to bury or burn the dead, and that each body should have two gold pieces placed on its eyes, the expected payment for the Ferryman.

## Sacrifice to the Gods
Kyrah reminds the players that the dying boar should  be sacrificed to the gods. It will be a great offense to the gods and mortals if it does not die as a proper offering. The sacrifice will cause the god to grow in power. 

The heroes will need to gather wood to build a sacrificial bier and burn the beast. They need to decide whom to sacrifice the beast too. Kyrah reminds the party that the Order of Sydon demanded the beast be sacrificed to the Lord of Storms. Kyrah strongly encourages them not to sacrifice the beast to Lutheria or Sydon as it will strengthen their domination over the land.
