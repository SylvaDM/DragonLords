You have a tragic past. Something terrible happened to you when you were young, and it forced you to reckon with the darkness within much sooner than anyone should ever have to. This tragic event shaped your identity and drove you to become who you are today. You know that it was a dragon who was responsible for destroying your childhood. The dragon might have razed your village to the ground—or it might have ruined your life in more insidious ways while polymorphed into the shape of a man or woman. Either way, you wish to discover the identity and the location of the dragon so that you can seek it out and exact brutal vengeance upon it.

**Adventure Hook:** The Oracle knows how to find the dragon that was responsible for your tragedy.

-  To find items that are key to killing dragons. Armor of Resistance—Fire: this can be any armour type. Dragonslayer: Spear

### Divine Blessing
Blessing of Dragon Slaying. You have advantage on all attacks against creatures with the dragon type. Creatures with the dragon type have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells.


# DM Notes


## Epic Path -  The Dragonslayer

The dragon responsible for the tragedy that destroyed the Dragonslayer’s childhood home is the gold dragon known as Helios.

### Meeting the Oracle
Versi tells the Dragonslayer that they are destined to become the bane of evil dragons. They must seek out the Forgekeeper in the Mithral Mines to learn more about the artifacts they need.

### The Mithral Forge
The Forgekeeper will give the Dragonslayer their lesser magic item. The Forgekeeper says that the Dragonslayer must obtain a weapon powerful enough to fight a dragon. The gygans of Yonder supposedly forged such weapons in the First War.

### Consulting the Fates
The Fates reveal that the Dragonslayer should seek the wisdom of the Sun God under the constellation of The Chariot. He will help the Dragonslayer find the revenge that they seek.

### The Forbidden Library
The Dragonslayer’s greater magic item can be found in the possession of Chondrus on the Island of Yonder. He will offer it willingly if the players agree to his bargain.

### Confronting Helios
 If the Dragonslayer arrives at the Garden of Helios, the Sun God will focus all of his attention on them. During dinner with Helios the Sun God will reveal that he has been waiting for the Dragonslayer’s arrival for a long time. The Fates told him that he would be killed by someone in the Dragonslayer’s family/town/tribe, so he rained fire down upon their home long ago. Once Helios assumes his dragon form, he attempts to devour the Dragonslayer

### Confronting Talieus
In the Great Arena at the Tower of Sydon, Talieus and his audience will focus their ridicule on the Dragonslayer, and the dragons will prioritize attacking the Dragonslayer.

### Divine Boon
If the Dragonslayer is ever killed, they will be visited by Morta (the night hag) from the Island of the Fates. She will raise the Dragonslayer from the dead and reveal that their fate is not to die here. This can only happen once.
