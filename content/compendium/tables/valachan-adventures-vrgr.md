**Valachan Adventures**

`dice: [](valachan-adventures-vrgr.md#^valachan-adventures)`

| dice: d8 | Adventure |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The Oselo joyously adopt a new member into their community, but the ceremony erupts in strife when Chakuna appears and demands that all newcomers participate in the Trial of Hearts. |
| 2 | Shuaran warriors seek help in slaying a massive saber-toothed tiger killing their people. They don't mention that they recently lost the Cat of Felkovic, a sentient magic item similar to a [figurine of wondrous power](compendium/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power.md) that conjures a feline killer. |
| 3 | A sapient [giant spider](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) emerges from the caverns known as the Council of the Whip Spider. It demands that the Oselo provide it a sacrifice, or every arachnid in Valachan will attack the village. |
| 4 | The tyrannosaurus rex called Mother Heartless rampages from the Forest of Fossils, incensed by something amiss in her hunting grounds. |
| 5 | The [lizardfolk](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) of the lakes surrounding the Anquara Plateau discover a submerged ruin and unleash an aboleth that now holds them in thrall. |
| 6 | Beast-shaped [treants](compendium/bestiary/plant/treant.md) animate and lay siege to Pantara Lodge, obeying Urik von Kharkov's will. |
| 7 | The merchant ship Zodiac runs aground on Kiru Island. The sailors seek help salvaging other shipwrecks and escaping back to seaâ€”preferably before Chakuna notices them. |
| 8 | A pack of displacer beasts washes up dead in Sangui Cove. An enraged Chakuna prowls the jungle, slaying anyone she suspects of being involved. |
