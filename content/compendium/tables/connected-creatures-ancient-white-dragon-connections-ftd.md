`dice: [](connected-creatures-ancient-white-dragon-connections-ftd.md#^ancient-white-dragon-connections)`

| dice: d4 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [death knight](compendium/bestiary/undead/death-knight.md) and an ancient white dragon swap tales of old foes and unanswered grievances, nursing the hunger for vengeance that sustains them. |
| 2 | An ancient white dragon makes intermittent assaults against a mated pair of adult silver dragons who lair nearby. |
| 3 | An ancient white dragon guards a [lich's](compendium/bestiary/undead/lich.md) phylactery, keeping it sealed in a tomb of ice. The lich visits periodically, bearing fabulous treasures as payment. |
| 4 | A community of orcs believe an ancient white dragon to be the reincarnation of a legendary leader. They've been venerating the dragon so long that the dragon now believes the story and speaks proudly in Orc about the orcs' triumphs. |
