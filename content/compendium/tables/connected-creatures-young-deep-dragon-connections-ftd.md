| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [young deep dragon](compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) has captured a number of kuo-toa and has decided to try them out as servants instead of eating them. |
| 2 | A [young deep dragon](compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) maintains the guise of a handsome Humanoid artist so as to maintain an adoring cult of drow and duergar admirers. |
| 3 | A rather snooty bone naga serves as a [young deep dragon's](compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) loyal butler, as it did for the dragon's parent. |
| 4 | A [young deep dragon](compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) has organized a society of hobgoblin explorers, whose members seek out new places in the Underdark for the dragon to visit. |
| 5 | A doppelganger mimics a [young deep dragon's](compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) Humanoid form while committing a string of murders, hoping to turn local Underdark settlements against the dragon. |
| 6 | Despite repeated [mind flayer](compendium/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) attacks, a [young deep dragon](compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-deep-dragon-ftd.md) refuses to leave the cave where the dragon's best friend—an adventurer who won the dragon's respect and affection—lingers as a [ghost](compendium/bestiary/undead/ghost.md). |
