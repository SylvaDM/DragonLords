| 3 | A faerie dragon uses magic to aid in the rambling revels of a band of satyrs. |
| 4 | A faerie dragon and a [quasit](compendium/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) are sworn enemies, and their invisible battles and the elaborate traps they lay for each other cause havoc in the area where they both live. |
| 5 | A mercenary band keeps a faerie dragon captive in a cage, forcing the dragon to act as a jester. |

| 8 | A green dragon wyrmling has recruited a faerie dragon as a spy, though the faerie dragon's bizarre means of carrying out orders leaves the green dragon wondering if it's worth the effort. |
| 9 | A faerie dragon constantly tries to impress a gruff dwarf priest by proselytizing to everyone they meet as they travel together, but the dragon's interpretation of their "shared faith" is extremely eccentric. |
| 10 | A faerie dragon has intimidated a gang of [goblins](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) and now forces the goblins to follow an increasingly bizarre set of rules. |
