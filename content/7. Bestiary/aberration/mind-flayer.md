## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The mind flayer's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

**At will**: [detect thoughts](compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [levitate](compendium/spells/levitate.md)

**1/day each**: [dominate monster](compendium/spells/dominate-monster.md), [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be [stunned](rules/conditions.md#stunned) until this grapple ends.

***Extract Brain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) humanoid [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the mind flayer. *Hit:* The target takes 55 (`10d10`) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (`4d8 + 4`) psychic damage and be [stunned](rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
